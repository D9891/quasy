There are novel insights regarding heart failure that provide a platform for personalized medicine. This is a review of the existent data about heart failure in women, a neglected topic that has gained considerable interest in the past years.Heart failure in women differs in many aspects from that of men. Part of the difference is attributable to age, ventricular function and cause of heart failure, with women being generally older at heart failure onset, more often without left ventricular systolic dysfunction and less often having heart failure due to ischaemic heart disease, in comparison with men. Elucidation of the genetic and pathophysiological basis of sex differences, together with clinical trials designed to study the impact of treatments in women, could lead to sex based heart failure management.","pmid":"22567052","ranges":[{"attribute":"Title[0]","begin":69,"end":74},{"attribute":"Title[0]","begin":46,"end":53},{"attribute":"Title[0]","begin":40,"end":45},{"attribute":"Abstract[0]","begin":212,"end":219},{"attribute":"Abstract[0]","begin":321,"end":328},{"attribute":"Abstract[0]","begin":419,"end":426},{"attribute":"Abstract[0]","begin":565,"end":572},{"attribute":"Abstract[0]","begin":616,"end":623},{"attribute":"Abstract[0]","begin":716,"end":723},{"attribute":"Abstract[0]","begin":969,"end":976},{"attribute":"Abstract[0]","begin":206,"end":211},{"attribute":"Abstract[0]","begin":315,"end":320},{"attribute":"Abstract[0]","begin":559,"end":564},{"attribute":"Abstract[0]","begin":610,"end":615},{"attribute":"Abstract[0]","begin":710,"end":715},{"attribute":"Abstract[0]","begin":741,"end":746},{"attribute":"Abstract[0]","begin":963,"end":968},{"attribute":"Abstract[0]","begin":407,"end":418},{"attribute":"Abstract[0]","begin":918,"end":928},{"attribute":"Sections[0]","begin":284,"end":291},{"attribute":"Sections[0]","begin":615,"end":622},{"attribute":"Sections[0]","begin":662,"end":669},{"attribute":"Sections[0]","begin":969,"end":976},{"attribute":"Sections[0]","begin":1240,"end":1247},{"attribute":"Sections[0]","begin":1851,"end":1858},{"attribute":"Sections[0]","begin":1984,"end":1991},{"attribute":"Sections[0]","begin":278,"end":283},{"attribute":"Sections[0]","begin":609,"end":614},{"attribute":"Sections[0]","begin":656,"end":661},{"attribute":"Sections[0]","begin":963,"end":968},{"attribute":"Sections[0]","begin":1845,"end":1850},{"attribute":"Sections[0]","begin":1978,"end":1983},{"attribute":"Sections[0]","begin":1204,"end":1213},{"attribute":"Sections[0]","begin":1233,"end":1239},{"attribute":"Sections[1]","begin":81,"end":88},{"attribute":"Sections[1]","begin":113,"end":120},{"attribute":"Sections[1]","begin":170,"end":177},{"attribute":"Sections[1]","begin":205,"end":212},{"attribute":"Sections[1]","begin":393,"end":400},{"attribute":"Sections[1]","begin":561,"end":568},{"attribute":"Sections[1]","begin":756,"end":763},{"attribute":"Sections[1]","begin":884,"end":891},{"attribute":"Sections[1]","begin":1222,"end":1229},{"attribute":"Sections[1]","begin":1319,"end":1326},{"attribute":"Sections[1]","begin":1501,"end":1508},{"attribute":"Sections[1]","begin":2330,"end":2337},{"attribute":"Sections[1]","begin":2693,"end":2700},{"attribute":"Sections[1]","begin":2768,"end":2775},{"attribute":"Sections[1]","begin":2920,"end":2927},{"attribute":"Sections[1]","begin":3228,"end":3235},{"attribute":"Sections[1]","begin":3331,"end":3338},{"attribute":"Sections[1]","begin":3745,"end":3752},{"attribute":"Sections[1]","begin":4287,"end":4294},{"attribute":"Sections[1]","begin":6359,"end":6366},{"attribute":"Sections[1]","begin":6452,"end":6459},{"attribute":"Sections[1]","begin":12,"end":17},{"attribute":"Sections[1]","begin":75,"end":80},{"attribute":"Sections[1]","begin":107,"end":112},{"attribute":"Sections[1]","begin":164,"end":169},{"attribute":"Sections[1]","begin":199,"end":204},{"attribute":"Sections[1]","begin":321,"end":326},{"attribute":"Sections[1]","begin":387,"end":392},{"attribute":"Sections[1]","begin":555,"end":560},{"attribute":"Sections[1]","begin":750,"end":755},{"attribute":"Sections[1]","begin":878,"end":883},{"attribute":"Sections[1]","begin":1003,"end":1008},{"attribute":"Sections[1]","begin":1216,"end":1221},{"attribute":"Sections[1]","begin":1313,"end":1318},{"attribute":"Sections[1]","begin":1495,"end":1500},{"attribute":"Sections[1]","begin":2293,"end":2298},{"attribute":"Sections[1]","begin":2324,"end":2329},{"attribute":"Sections[1]","begin":2687,"end":2692},{"attribute":"Sections[1]","begin":2762,"end":2767},{"attribute":"Sections[1]","begin":2873,"end":2878},{"attribute":"Sections[1]","begin":2914,"end":2919},{"attribute":"Sections[1]","begin":3222,"end":3227},{"attribute":"Sections[1]","begin":3325,"end":3330},{"attribute":"Sections[1]","begin":3464,"end":3469},{"attribute":"Sections[1]","begin":3739,"end":3744},{"attribute":"Sections[1]","begin":4217,"end":4222},{"attribute":"Sections[1]","begin":4281,"end":4286},{"attribute":"Sections[1]","begin":6353,"end":6358},{"attribute":"Sections[1]","begin":4223,"end":4241},{"attribute":"Sections[1]","begin":3609,"end":3618},{"attribute":"Sections[1]","begin":18,"end":30},{"attribute":"Sections[1]","begin":6296,"end":6303},{"attribute":"Sections[1]","begin":5055,"end":5062},{"attribute":"Sections[2]","begin":319,"end":326},{"attribute":"Sections[2]","begin":313,"end":318},{"attribute":"Sections[2]","begin":1968,"end":1972},{"attribute":"Sections[3]","begin":85,"end":92},{"attribute":"Sections[3]","begin":585,"end":592},{"attribute":"Sections[3]","begin":656,"end":663},{"attribute":"Sections[3]","begin":79,"end":84},{"attribute":"Sections[3]","begin":579,"end":584},{"attribute":"Sections[3]","begin":650,"end":655},{"attribute":"Sections[4]","begin":414,"end":421},{"attribute":"Sections[4]","begin":554,"end":561},{"

until recently, epidemiological and clinical data regarding cardiovascular health were extrapolated to the entire population, recently published studies have shown that there are obvious, sex related differences, in terms of cardiovascular disease in general and heart failure in particular. The idea of a personalized approach of this pathology came into light with the evidence of different gene profiles in female and male. Autosomal genes (GATAD1, SCLA12, PDE6B) involved in the metabolism of cyclic nucleotides, glucose transport and neurohumoral stimulation were identified in women with heart failure, unlike the male population with heart failure, where the genes responsible for arrhythmias, self immunity and cellular homeostasis (KCNK1, CD24, PLEKHA8) were overexpressed [1] (Table 1). It is believed that gender-specific differences in gene expression may explain the physiopathological and clinical differences between sexes regarding heart failure. In this context, personalized medicine gained an increasing interest, the target being the understanding of the impact of gender differences, establishing a strictly individualized disease approach and obtaining the leads for treatment optimization.Table 1Heart failure: gender–specific differences in gene expression (modified after [1,2]).\nWOMENMENRegulation in gene expression of adrenergic and angiotensin signaling (GATAD1)Regulation in gene expression of potassium channel (KCNK 1)Regulation in gene expression of glucose transporter (SLCS2A12) Autosomal gene CD24, that through its expression on leucocytes may have an important function in immunological\nprocesses \nRegulation in gene expression of phosphodiesterase (PDE6B) Regulation in gene expression of cellular homeostasis (PLEKHA 8)Although more than half of the patients diagnosed and hospitalized for heart failure are women, they are underrepresented in most of the clinical studies. Even in recent trials, only 20% of patients with heart failure are women. This explains the limited analysis of sex related differences in cardiovascular pathology [3].","Etiology of heart failureThere are gender differences regarding the age at heart failure onset, as well as heart failure etiology and risk factors in patients with heart failure [4]. Unlike men with heart failure, in whom the ischemic etiology prevails, the main risk factors in women are arterial hypertension, valvular heart disease and atrial fibrillation [5] (Table 2).Women develop heart failure at higher age and this is why they cumulate more risk factors [6]. Many studies have found arterial hypertension to be the most important risk factor for heart failure in women. The significant prevalence in women over 55 years old has been attributed to higher systolic blood pressure after menopause. A strong correlation between hypertension and heart failure has also been observed in young afro-American women with uncontrolled blood pressure.Table 2Etiologic spectrum of heart failure in women (according to 5,12).\nMAIN CAUSESPARTICULAR FORMSArterial hypertensionDiabetes mellitusObesityValvular heart diseaseVulnerability to ischemiaX–linked cardiomyopathyPeripartum cardiomyopathyTako–Tsubo cardiomyopathyToxic cardiomyopathy (ethanol, antracicline)Diabetes mellitus is associated with an increased risk of heart failure in female patients, this being proved since the Framingham study: the incidence of heart failure was 4–5 times higher in diabetic women compared to non–diabetic women and twice higher than in diabetic male subjects. The probability for diabetic patients to develop heart failure is strongly linked to the glycemic control. A study made on more than 48.000 diabetic patients showed a probability of 4.2\/1000\/year at a HbA1c value of less than 7% and a probability of 9.2\/1000\/year at a HbA1c value of more than 10% [7]. The endothelial dysfunction is a characteristic of diabetes, and endothelium–derived substances may have profound effects on myocardial structure and function. For example, both endothelin and angiotensin II cause myocardial hypertrophy and increased interstitial connective tissue, which can explain the higher left ventricle mass in patients who associate diabetes and hypertension, compared to nondiabetic hypertensive patients. Therefore, it is not surprising that diabetes is one of the major factors, along with hypertension and coronary heart disease, associated with heart failure with normal systolic function, form frequently observed in women.Obesity, an integral component of the metabolic syndrome and type 2 diabetes,  predisposes to the toxic effects of fatty acids on the myocardium and the additional detrimental effects of cytokines and angiotensin II released by adipose tissue. Therefore, obesity is a risk factor for heart failure for both men and women. In the Framingham study, the risk of heart failure was twice higher for the obese persons compared to subjects with normal body weight [8].Valvular heart disease continues to be a cause of heart failure in women. According to the data published by Redberg et al., 70% of the patients diagnosed with mitral or aortic valve disease are women [9]. Rheumatic mitral stenosis due to rheumatic fever in childhood used to be a major cause of valve disease in female. This still is a major contributor of heart failure in some part of the underdeveloped world. In developed countries, a more common cause of heart failure is the degenerative valvular disease with aortic stenosis, this being the classic example.Although the incidence of coronary heart disease is lower in women, the increased vulnerability to ischemia is notable [10]. The studies have shown that, regardless of the type of treatment (conservative\/myocardial revascularization), women who suffered a myocardial infarction are more predisposed to develop heart failure [11].Several types of cardiomyopathy are more frequently linked to the female sex. It has been consistently seen in literature that women are very vulnerable to an increased level of catecholamines, 90% of stress induced cardiomyopathies (Tako–Tsubo) being registered in women. Differences between men and women were also described regarding cardiotoxicity. At similar doses of chemotherapy (anthracycline class) or ethanol, women have a higher risk of developing heart failure.Peripartum cardiomyopathy is a particular case of heart failure with an etiology that is not completely known, with nonspecific diagnostic criteria and reserved prognosis. The incidence varies according to different studies and has been estimated to range from 1:2300 to 1:4000 pregnancies in Western countries. A geographical predilection is found in Haiti, with an estimated incidence of 1:299. Advanced maternal age, multiparity, multifetal pregnancy, preeclampsia and gestational hypertension are mentioned among the risk factors. Recently, the overexpression of 16–kDa prolactin was suggested to be a possible physiopathological mechanism for peripartum cardiomyopathy [12]. This proposed pathway emphasizes a coincidence of unbalanced oxidative stress, activation of the protease cathepsin D, that cleaves the nursing hormone prolactin into an angiostatic and proapoptotic 16–kDa form, which seems to drive the disease by systemically affecting the endothelium, as well as the cardiac vasculature and cardiomyocyte function. Consistent with this idea, blockade of prolactin by bromocriptine, a dopamine D2–receptor agonist, prevented the onset of disease in an experimental model of peripartum cardiomyopathy and appeared successful in small pilot trials. In the presence of risk factors and clinical suspicion in young women at the end of pregnancy or in the first 5 months postpartum, the diagnosis of  peripartum cardiomyopathy, based on exclusion criteria, is established by ultrasound investigation once the systolic dysfunction appears (the decrease of the ejection fraction under 45% and\/or fractional shortening under 30%). The prognosis is reserved because of the limited recovery (23–32% of all cases) and the high mortality rate (15% of all cases) [12].When speaking about X–linked cardiomyopathy in women, the slow progression and the late onset are remarkable features, females being heterozygote for the mutant allele. At the opposite pole, men with this condition become symptomatic since childhood.From the associated pathology point of view, thyroid dysfunction is more frequent in women with acute heart failure, while in men, obstructive pulmonary disease, peripheral vascular disease, and renal failure prevail. ","Physiopathological particularitiesThere is no opinion agreement regarding the existence of physiopathological particularities linked to sex because it is difficult to exclude the variables that could be responsible for those particular elements.Starting from the observation that women have a higher incidence of heart failure with preserved ejection fraction but with reduced diastolic compliance, the issue of sex–related variability of cardiac function came into light. The answer was given by a study that analyzed the diastolic compliance in healthy teenagers. For female gender, higher body mass index, ventricular rate, total peripheral stiffness and relative left ventricle walls thickness were observed. Lower values were registered for the E\/A ratio, suggesting that women have a higher probability to develop diastolic dysfunction even independent of the additional risk factors. The reason for those differences in filling and relaxation is not fully known. Although E\/A ratio can depend on ventricular rate, blood pressure, geometry and left ventricular systolic function, the multivariate analysis showed that sex had a significant influence on ventricular filling [13].Studies on adult patients showed, as a particular element in women, a higher capacity of the left ventricle to adapt to overload through concentric hypertrophy, unlike men who had a predisposition to ventricular dilation and contractile dysfunction [14,15]. Although the cause of this different response is not entirely understood, a reasonable explanation is offered by the sex–dependent variability of vascular and ventricular stiffness. There is a significant increase of vascular stiffness in women, with age. In order to maintain the optimal ventriculoarterial interaction, the ventricle develops increasing elasticity, both systolic and diastolic, which has the advantage of preserving the ejection fraction and the disadvantage of altering the relaxation. It remains a dilemma what the factors that determine the increase of arterial stiffness in women are. Among the proposed mechanisms, endothelium dysfunction is a notable factor, frequent in women, as well as the differences in protein structure and in neurohumoral signal [16].","Clinical presentationThe severity of symptoms is one clinical particularity of heart failure in women. The MONICA study (Multinational MONItoring of trends and determinants in CArdiovascular disease) showed that, in similar contractile parameters, women are more symptomatic than men [17]. The prevalence and the increased severity of symptoms were attributed on one hand to the lower level of pain perception, and on the other hand to depression. The neurological disorders like loss of memory and depression were correlated to a significant hippocampus reduction in women with heart failure, compared to the control group and to male subjects with heart failure. Because women frequently have the tendency to empathize, the objective evaluation through clinical score systems is more difficult to achieve and the obtained data have usually reduced accuracy.","Paraclinical dataBoth quantitative and qualitative analyses of cardiac function have been rarely evaluated in female subjects. It is possible to have some differences between sexes regarding the paraclinic data, but because of the less frequently used diagnostic investigations, so far they have not been assessed [18,19].B–type natriuretic peptide, a biomarker used for risk stratification in patients with heart failure, registers higher values in normal females [20]. Therefore, the use of a different cutoff for the diagnosis and management of heart failure for the two sexes was suggested. The BASEL study (B–type natriuretic peptide for Acute Shortness of Breath Evaluation), that had as main purpose the  analysis of the prognostic role of BZ–type natriuretic peptide (BNP) in patients with acute dyspnea, showed that a higher level of BNP is a stronger predictor of death in women. The risk was 5.1 times higher in women with BNP> 500 pg\/ml than in those with BNP values below 500 pg\/ml, and for similar BNP values in men, the difference in risk was of only 1.8 [21]. However, further studies that enroll a sufficient number of female patients are needed to analyze the distribution of heart failure biomarkers and its prognostic significance.The electrocardiogram is among the first tests available for the evaluation of postmenopausal women. Repolarization abnormalities are prognostic predictors of heart failure and all–cause mortality, as significant as the presence of an old myocardial infarction on ECG; therefore, this should not be overlooked. The presence of repolarization abnormalities, particularly wide QRS\/T angle, may make a substantial difference in the number of new heart failure events and may warrant consideration of possibly intensified prevention efforts. A wide angle, expression of structural and functional myocardial abnormalities, increases the risk of heart failure by three times. Two other dominant repolarization variables, ST depression in V5, tall T wave in V1 lead, and QRS non–dipolar voltage were associated with a 2–fold increase in the risk of incident heart failure having the same prognostic value as a myocardial infarction [22].Through the analysis of heart frequency variability, the ECG Holter monitoring may bring information with prognostic value. There are studies that showed a strong correlation between a high variability of ventricular rate and heart failure [22].The effort capacity, evaluated through the 6-minute walk test is significantly higher in men with heart failure, compared to women with similar systolic dysfunction. In the First study, the effort tolerance and the mean pulmonary capillary wedge pressure proved to be independent predictors for survival in patients with heart failure [23].From the echocardiography point of view, the preservation of left ventricular systolic function is characteristic in women with heart failure. This was also the conclusion of the Framingham study, which showed that women represent 65% of patients with diastolic heart failure and only 25% of those with systolic dysfunction.","Diagnosis algorithm of heart failure in womenStudies show that the accuracy of heart failure diagnosis by clinical means alone is often inadequate, particularly in women. The diagnosis is established late in most of the female patients, clinical manifestations being attributed to other causes. Women were less likely to be hospitalized in a cardiology department and therefore have less chances of accurate assessment of cardiac function. In these circumstances, it is not surprising that heart failure in women is treated to a lesser extent according to present recommendations [24].In the context of reduced BNP dynamics, preserved ejection fraction and normal ventricular dimensions, heart failure is frequently underdiagnosed in women. Because of the high diastolic heart failure prevalence, it is necessary to know the three diagnostic elements: signs and symptoms of heart failure, normal left ventricle function or marginally abnormal (FEVS>50%), proofs of abnormal left ventricular relaxation [25]. The authors of the European Consensus regarding the diagnostic of heart failure with preserved ejection fraction [26], published in 2007, proposed a comprehensive algorithm for the clinical approach of this entity (Figure 1).Figure 1Diagnostic flowchart on How to diagnose HFNEF in a patient suspected of HFNEF (according to [26]). LVEDVI, left ventricular end–diastolic volume index; mPCW, mean pulmonary capillary wedge pressure; LVEDP, left ventricular end–diastolic pressure; t, time constant of left ventricular relaxation; b, constant of left ventricular chamber stiffness; TD, tissue Doppler; E, early mitral valve flow velocity; E0, early TD lengthening velocity; DT, deceleration time; LVMI, left ventricular mass index; LAVI, left atrial volume index; Ard, duration of reverse pulmonary vein atrial systole flow; Ad, duration of mitral valve atrial wave flow, >50 years old.\n","TreatmentThe therapy particularities in women were for a long time underestimated due to their absence from the big therapy trials. When women were included in studies, their number was significantly lower compared to men, and therefore the conclusions were incorrect, e.g. the modest benefit of angiotensin–converting enzyme inhibitors in female patients in SOLVD trial. This is one of the explanations for the suboptimal treatment in women with heart failure, regardless of age [27]. More men are treated with angiotensin–converting enzyme inhibitors, in part reflecting the high proportion of men with systolic dysfunction. A multicentric European study showed that fewer women with evidence of left ventricular systolic dysfunction were treated with drugs that have a documented impact on survival (angiotensin–converting enzyme inhibitors, β–blockers and spironolactone), whereas they receive more often cardiac glycosides and loop diuretics [28].An inverse correlation between plasma levels of omega–3 polyunsaturated fatty acids and incidence of heart failure was detected exclusively in women [29]. Moderate consumption of fish (1–2 meals\/week) and omega–3 fatty acids was associated with a lower rate of hospitalization and mortality in women with heart failure [30].Knowing the protective effect of hormones, the treatment with estrogen and combination estrogen–progesterone derivatives has been proposed. However, hormonal therapy has not proved effective in preventing heart failure or increasing survival [31]. Starting from the premise of muscle loss and reduced exercise capacity, testosterone treatment has been tried. In clinical trials, the results were encouraging, proving to increase muscular strength, and exercise tolerance and to reduce insulin resistance in women with advanced heart failure [32]. In a retrospective analysis of the SOLVD trial, women with heart failure had an increased risk of thromboembolic events compared with men. Although women have experienced more thromboembolic events (especially pulmonary), antiplatelet therapy and oral anticoagulant has been less frequently used in women [33].A sub–analysis of MADIT–CRT trial has revealed that women with heart failure have a particularly favorable response to cardiac resynchronization therapy with defibrillator function. Heart failure related events were reduced by 70% in women and only 35% in men. The same study showed a 72% reduction in all–cause mortality in women with heart failure who received resynchronization therapy with defibrillator function. An update of the 2008 ESC guidelines for the diagnosis and treatment of acute and chronic heart failure, and the 2007 ESC guidelines for cardiac and resynchronization therapy, sustain that substantial improvements in left ventricle size and function were greatest in patients with a QRS width of >150 ms, patients with left bundle, patients with non–ischaemic etiology, and in female patients [34], hence suggesting that a good accessibility of women to this therapy would be of great benefit in this population.Another recent report described that heart failure medication was not prescribed to target dose as recommended in the guidelines. Here, physician gender also played a role, with female patients treated by male physicians being least likely to receive the full dosage, and female doctors being more likely to prescribe target doses of heart failure medication to female patients [35].There are also gender differences regarding drug pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics. If the absorption, transport and volume of distribution did not differ significantly between women and men with heart failure, excretion and metabolism explains their different effects depending on gender. On average, glomerular filtration rate (GFR) is higher in men than in women. This difference is not gender–related; rather, it represents a body mass effect, in that GFR is directly proportional to weight and men typically outweigh women. In addition, women generally produce less creatinine than men, since they have less muscle mass, and muscle mass is the major determinant of creatinine generation. It follows that women have a lower normal range for serum creatinine values and that identical serum creatinine values in a man and a woman reflect considerably different GFRs. Circumstances such as these make serum creatinine a provisional indicator of renal function. Because GFR values are somewhat lower in women, a number of cardiovascular medications–including angiotensin–converting enzyme inhibitors, certain β blockers, several antiarrhythmics, and digoxin will systemically accumulate upon repeat dosing unless medication doses are reduced.Supplementary, the metabolic rate of drugs through the cytochrome P450 is reduced in female patients. In this context, we need to assess the complications associated with the pharmacological treatment that are more frequently reported in women. These differences are especially evident in the risk of proarrhythmic responses of women to medications that prolong the QT interval. Women are at greater risk for torsade de pointes from antiarrhythmic medications due to longer baseline QT intervals, than men, and a greater degree of QT prolongation for the same drug levels compared with men. Despite careful dosing based on creatinine clearance, the incidence of torsade de pointes with dofetilide is higher in women than in men. Regardless, there are no gender–specific guidelines for the administration of these agents. Therefore, there is evidence that the commonly used indicators of risk for malignant arrhythmias may be less sensitive for women than for men. The question may then be raised whether separate criteria are needed for risk stratification and treatment of arrhythmias in men and women. The answer to this question is far from clear–largely due to the limited data. Furthermore, female–specific issues such as pregnancy, menopause, oral contraceptive use, and menstruation may independently influence drug metabolism and serve as confounders to the interpretation of gender differences in drug handling or effect [36].With the discovery of prolactin effects on the cardiovascular system: the impairing of remodelation and vascular formation, the destruction of cardiac microvascularization, the interference with cardiomyocyte metabolism, the decrease of the ejection fraction and ventricular dilatation, appeared the premises of the new therapy approach. Based on experimental observations that prolactin blockade with bromocriptine prevented the onset of peripartum cardiomyopathy, a specific treatment for these diseases has been developed [12].Females are also poorly represented in cardiac rehabilitation programs. The low participation is attributed to older age, reduced tolerance to effort and associated comorbidities. Studies have shown the existence of socio–familial differences, which could explain the low number of women who benefit from cardiac rehabilitation: women have more family and social duties, but more difficulties in terms of financial resources, transport, or family support. However, no sex–dependent differences in relation to the benefit of cardiac rehabilitation were demonstrated.","CautionsPregnancy may lead to deterioration of heart failure due to the rise in blood volume and increase in cardiac output, as well as the substantial increase in extravascular fluid. The risk of pregnancy is considered greater than the risks linked to contraceptive use. It is recommended that women with heart failure discuss contraceptives and planned pregnancy with a physician in order to take an informed decision based on assessment of potential risks (class I recommendations, C level of evidence: ESC Guidelines for the diagnosis and treatment of acute and chronic heart failure 2008).PrognosisHeart failure has become the most important public health problem in cardiovascular medicine. The incidence of heart failure has increased with 9% in women and 6% in men during the last 20 years [37]. Mortality at 5 years after diagnosis reached 75%, being surpassed only by the one registered in bronchopulmonary cancer.The FIRST trial (Flolan Randomizen Survival Trial) showed a two times higher rate of survival for women with advanced heart failure compared to men. Female sex has favorable prognosis regarding all–cause mortality, cardiovascular related death and hospitalization for heart failure. Subgroup analysis suggests this finding is strongest among patients with heart failure with preserved ejection fraction and in patients with nonischemic heart failure. Better understanding of the biological and psychosocial factors that contribute to the survival advantage of women with heart failure may ultimately allow improved management of patients with this deadly syndrome.ConclusionsFor a long period of time, women have been profoundly underrepresented in clinical trials, and the influence of sex on cardiovascular pathophysiology was neglected. Recent studies showed significant differences between men and women with heart failure. Although, more clinical trials are needed in this field, the current tendency towards a similar approach to all patients with heart failure has to be changed."],"title":"Lifetime risk for developing congestive heart failure–the Framingham Heart Study\n      "},{"documentAbstract":"Obesity is a major public health issue worldwide. Current pharmacological treatments are largely unsuccessful. Determining the complex pathways that regulate food intake may aid the development of new treatments. The hypothalamic-pituitary-thyroid (HPT) axis has well-known effects on energy expenditure, but its role in the regulation of food intake is less well characterised. Evidence suggests that the HPT axis can directly influence food intake. Thyroid dysfunction can have clinically significant consequences on appetite and body weight. Classically, these effects were thought to be mediated by the peripheral effects of thyroid hormone. However, more recently, local regulation of thyroid hormone in the central nervous system (CNS) is thought to play an important role in physiologically regulating appetite.

Introduction\n\t\t\t\tObesity, its complications, and the associated mortality are major public health issues worldwide. The major central nervous system (CNS) areas important in the regulation of appetite are the hypothalamus and brainstem. The hypothalamus interprets and integrates afferent signals from the periphery and brainstem to modulate efferent signals that regulate food intake and energy expenditure. Neural and hormonalperipheral signals communicate information including acute nutritional states and energy stores. The hypothalamus is subdivided into a number of interconnecting nuclei, including the paraventricular nucleus (PVN), the ventromedial nucleus (VMN), and the arcuate nucleus (ARC), which are particularly important in regulating energy homeostasis. The ARC is located near the median eminence, where the blood-brain barrier is incomplete, and is thus well positioned to respond to circulating factors involved in appetite and food intake [1]. Recent evidence suggests that thyroid hormones may access the ARC and other regions of the hypothalamus to regulate appetite (Figure 1). It is well established that the hypothalamic-pituitary-thyroid (HPT) axis regulates body weight. Thyroid hormones are known to effect metabolic rate. Thyroid dysfunction can have clinically significant consequences on appetite and body weight. Hypothyroidism classically causes reduced basal energy expenditure [2] with weight gain [3, 4]. Conversely, hyperthyroidism increases energy expenditure and reduces body weight [5–7]. Traditionally, it has been assumed that it is this reduced body weight that drives the hyperphagia that can be a presenting feature in hyperthyroidism. However, recent evidence suggests that the HPT axis may play a direct role in the hypothalamic regulation of appetite, independent of effects on energy expenditure. Classically, hypothalamic thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH) stimulates thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) release from the anterior pituitary gland, which then stimulates the release of both thyroid hormones, tri-iodothyronine (T3) and thyroxine (T4). Reports suggest that all of these signalling molecules can directly influence food intake [8–11]. Improved understanding of the role of the HPT axis and thyroid hormone in appetite may identify new targets for antiobesity agents. ","2. Effects of Thyroid Hormones on Food Intake (Table 1)There are well-characterised effects of fasting on hypothalamic TRH expression. This is primarily thought to downregulate the HPT axis in periods of limited food availability, thus reducing food intake. However, TRH has been reported to have direct anorectic effects, suggesting it may regulate food intake independent of effects on the HPT axis. In rodents, central administration of TRH reduces food intake [8, 12, 13]; similar effects on food intake are seen following peripheral administration [14].TSH has also been shown to reduce food intake when injected centrally into rats [8]. There is evidence that TSH from the pars tuberalis is involved in the photoperiodic response in birds and rodents, and it is thus possible that TSH is involved with the seasonal alterations in food intake and body weight that occur in some species [15–17]. The hyperphagia associated with hyperthyroidism may be a result of thyroid hormones acting directly on CNS appetite circuits. T3 directly stimulates food intake at the level of the hypothalamus. In rodent models, peripheral and central hypothalamic administration of T3 increases food intake [9–11].There are several mechanisms postulated to mediate the orexigenic effects of thyroid hormones. The ARC contains two distinct energy homeostasis-regulating neuronal populations. One subpopulation expresses the pro-opiomelanocortin (POMC) gene which codes for the anorectic neuropeptide alpha-melanocyte-stimulating hormone (α-MSH). The other expresses the orexigenic factors neuropeptide Y (NPY) and agouti-related protein (AgRP). It has been reported that peripheral administration of T3 increases hypothalamic NPY mRNA and that intracerebroventricular (ICV) administration of a NPY Y1 receptor antagonist blunts T3 induced hyperphagia, suggesting that T3 may increase appetite via NPY [10]. T3 administration was also reported toalso reduce hypothalamic POMC expression [10]. Another study did not detect changes in hypothalamic neuropeptide expression in response to peripheral administration of T3 though this may reflect the different doses of T3 administered [9].However, the effects of thyroid hormones on food intake may not be mediated directly by the ARC. Direct administration of T3 into the VMN but not the ARC increases food intake in rats [9]. As appetite regulating circuits in the ARC are known to be altered by changes in the HPT, there may be an indirect effect of the ARC via the VMN allowing intra-VMN T3 to increase food intake. In keeping with this, there are excitatory inputs into POMC neurons that originate in the VMN [18]. The effects of T3 in the VMN may be mediated by glutamate [19] and\/or brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) neurons [20]. The VMN is likely to be the source of glutamatergic neurons that modulate ARC POMC neurons. It has not been investigated whether T3, for example, inhibits glutamate synthesis and\/or release to disrupt excitatory input into POMC neurons. However, it is interesting to note that there is evidence from other tissues that HPT activity can regulate glutamatergic neuronal machinery. For example, hypothyroidism increases expression of the vesicular glutamate transporter vGLUT-2 in the anterior pituitary [21]. BDNF is a protein belonging to the neurotrophin family of growth factors, which regulate growth, differentiation and survival of neurons. BDNF is highly expressed in the VMN and is reduced by 60% with fasting chronic ICV administration of BDNF significantly reduces food intake in rats [22]. BDNF is thought to act via the tyrosine kinase receptor TrkB. In accord with this, rodents with reduced TrkB expression develop hyperphagia and obesity [23]. In vitro data suggest that T3 reduces BDNF gene expression when applied to hypothalamic explants [20]. However, VMN BDNF may not be physiologically important in the regulation of food intake. Steroidogenic factor-1 (SF1) is a transcription factor which is expressed in of the VMN and which is often used as a molecular marker for the VMN. Leptin depolarizes and increases the firing rate of VMN SF1 neurons, suggesting they are involved in the regulation of energy homeostasis. Mice specifically lacking BDNF in SF1 neurons do not develop the obese phenotype observed in other BDNF-deficient models, suggesting that VMN BDNF may not play an important role in food intake [24]. Further work is required to determine the role of BDNF in mediating the effects of T3 on appetite. The enzyme 5′ adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase (AMPK) is thought to act as a sensor which regulates cellular energy homeostasis. AMPK is activated by phosphorylation, and AMPK activation in the ARC increases food intake [25]. Peripherally administered T3 increases hypothalamic AMPK phosphorylation, which thus may mediate the orexigenic effects of T3 [11]. Thyroid hormone derivatives have also been implicated in the regulation of appetite. G protein-coupled trace amine-associated receptor 1 (TAAR1) is expressed in the rat hypothalamus and is associated with the regulation of energy homeostasis. Thyroid hormone derivative 3-iodothyronamine (T1AM), an endogenous biogenic amine, is a potent agonist of TAAR1. Rodent studies show that T1AM significantly increases food intake in rats, when administered intraperitoneally, ICV, or directly into the ARC [26]. However, the physiological relevance of these effects remains unknown.The thyroid hormone receptor (TR) or receptors that mediate the effects of thyroid hormones on appetite are unknown. There are two main types of thyroid hormone receptors—thyroid hormone receptor α (THRA) and thyroid hormone receptor β (THRB), each coded by a distinct gene. These genes are alternately spliced to generate three major highly homologous nuclear receptor isoforms (TRα1, TRβ1, and TRβ2) with specific tissue distributions [27]. The three main isoforms bind T3 with high affinity, and regulate thyroid hormone-mediated transcription. TRα is the main isoform regulating T3 activity in the heart, skeletal muscle, bone and brain; TRβ is the main isoform regulating T3 activity in the liver. Adipose tissue expresses both TRα and TRβ. TRβ1 is expressed in most tissues, whilst TRβ2 is expressed solely in the hypothalamus, pituitary, cochlea, and retina [28, 29]. All three isoforms are expressed in the human hypothalamus in a number of nuclei, including the infundibular nucleus, the human equivalent of the ARC, and the supraoptic and paraventricular nuclei. Although thyroid hormones can directly increase food intake in the hypothalamus, selectively targeting TR subtypes have been shown to have beneficial metabolic effects. Activation of the TRβ receptor reduces body weight in obese rats [30], which may be a result of an increase in metabolic rate. Hence, TRβ agonists have been proposed as treatments for obesity. Targeting the TR with a TRβ-selective agonist may determine whether these agents address the metabolic effects of thyroid hormone, without effects on the TRα-expressing tissues such as the heart [30]. Peripheral administration of a TRβ-selective agonist to rats during feeding with a high-fat diet prevents the expected increases in fat mass, glucose intolerance, and hypertriglyceridaemia [31]. These effects may reflect the increased energy expenditure observed in rodents treated with a TRβ-selective agonist rather than the effects of thyroid hormones on appetite [32]. Further work is required to identify the receptor responsible for the orexigenic effects of T3 in the hypothalamus. ","3. Effects of Nutritional State on Thyroid HormonesReduction in TRH in response to fasting may be important as TRH is seen to have a direct anorectic effect when injected into the hypothalamus [13]. It is possible there are distinct TRH neuronal populations regulating the HPT axis and regulating appetite. In periods of limited food availability, there is central downregulation of the HPT axis. Serum T4 and T3 levels fall during fasting in humans [33] and rodents [34, 35]. As the majority of T3 in rodents comes from the thyroid gland, it is thought food deprivation may result in a fall in the release of T4 and T3. This is likely secondary to a reduction in hypothalamic TRH expression, an effect that may be mediated by the adipose hormone leptin (Figure 2). Leptin is an adipocytokine that circulates in proportion to white adipose tissue and communicates information regarding body fat stores to the CNS. Administration of leptin can reverse starvation induced changes of the HPT axis [34, 36, 37]. Leptin administration partially prevents the reduction in total T4 clearly observed in fasted mice [34]. Humans and mice with mutations of leptin receptor or leptin itself exhibit central hypothyroidism [38, 39], which is ameliorated in leptin-deficient humans by the administration of leptin [40]. Leptin may directly regulate TRH expression in the PVN and may indirectly regulate TRH via effects in the ARC. Leptin increases α-MSH release and decreasesAgRP release, which results in a downregulation of TRH expression. There is also emerging evidence of the existence of a melanocortin-independent pathway by which leptin can influence the HPT axis; cotreatment with a potent melanocortin 4 receptor (MC4R) antagonist diminishes but does not fully block leptin action in restoring total T4 in a rodent model [41].However, the changes in the HPT axis and peripheral thyroid hormone levels are at odds with the reported effects of thyroid hormones on appetite. If thyroid hormones physiologically increase appetite, they would be predicted to increase, rather than decrease in starvation. Evidence suggests that rather than systemic thyroid hormone levels, it is local CNS concentrations of thyroid hormones that are important in the regulation of appetite.","4. Central Changes in T3 Levels Mediated by  D2 and D3A group of enzymes known as the deiodinases (thioredoxin fold enzymes) regulates the activation and inactivation of T3 and T4. These enzymes are responsible for regulating centralthyroid hormone levels. There are three types of deiodinase, each with an active site containing the amino acid selenocysteine, which is critical for the deiodination reaction catalysed by these enzymes. Deiodinases act by selectively removing of iodine from T4 and its derivatives. Iodine may be removed from the inner (tyrosyl) or outer (phenolic) ring. Deiodinase 1 (D1) is expressed predominantly in the liver, kidney, and thyroid in humans and rodents. However, Deiodinase 2 (D2) and Deiodinase 3 (D3) are highly expressed within the CNS, with some peripheral expression. The expression of each enzyme is regulated individually by thyroid hormone. Within the hypothalamus, expression and activity of D2 and D3 depend on nutritional circumstances, leading to tissue specific changes in hypothalamic T3 availability that may be important in the regulation of food intake and energy expenditure (Figure 3).D2 catalyses the conversion of T4 to T3 to generate intracellular T3 [42]. It is particularly important in the brain. D2 plays an important part in thyroid hormone-mediated feedback regulation of TRH production. Dio2 knockout mice have higher levels of serum T4 and TSH; however, administration of T3, but not T4, suppresses TSH, suggesting central T4 resistance [43]. Hence the activity of D2 is crucial in the feedback regulation of TSH secretion. T3-driven suppression of TRH expression in the PVN [44] can be prevented by infusion of the D2 inhibitor iopanoic acid [45]. D2 is not expressed in hypophysiotropic neurons [46] but is highly expressed in tanycytes [47], specialised endothelial cells which line the third ventricle. Tanycytes express two thyroid hormone specific transporters: monocarboxylate transporter 8 (MCT8) and organic anion transporting polypeptide 1C1 (OATP1C1) in rodent models [48]. D2 mediates the conversion of T4 to T3 within these tanycytes, allowing T3 to access the TRH neurons of the PVN. MCT8 is thought to modulate neuronal uptake of thyroid hormone in mice [49], ensuring that TRH production is regulated by peripheral T4 concentration, under basal conditions. Expression of Dio2 and D2 activity are increased in hypothyroidism [50] and fall with the administration of T4, protecting tissues from the adverse effects of extremes of thyroid dysfunction [51].Hypothalamic D2 expression is not just regulated by thyroid status. In rodents, fasting also increases hypothalamic D2 expression and activity [9, 37], and this effect is not reversed by systemic administration of T4 [45]. It can, however, be reversed by leptin administration [37], suggesting it is more important in energy homeostasis than the HPT axis. Leptin restores the hypothalamic and pituitary components of the HPT axis during fasting, but directly blunts the response of the thyroidgland, resulting in low plasma T4 and T3 [37]. Hence, normalization of thyroid hormone may depend on changes in deiodinase activities and the long-term thyroid stimulation by TSH to oppose these direct inhibitory effects of leptin on the thyroid. D2 activity is particularly high in the ARC and median eminence [52], where it is expressed within astrocytes and tanycytes. The processes of the D2 containing tanycytes are in direct contact with NPY\/AgRP neurons of the ARC which also express UCP2 [53]. Uncoupling protein 1 (UCP1) is thought to be integral to the process of brown-fat-associated nonshivering thermogenesis, as it dissipates energy in the form of heat [54]. The role of inner mitochondrial membrane uncoupling protein 2 (UCP2) is less well defined and tissue specific, but it is subject to regulation by T3 [55]. T3 is thought to access CNS target neurons via a number of different mechanisms. One is through a direct crossing of the blood-brain barrier (BBB). Alternatively T3 may cross the BBB via astrocytes encircling endothelial cells, following 5′ deiodination of T4 taken up from the blood. Astrocytes in the ARC are of particular importance as they express leptin receptors [56, 57]. Another postulated mechanism of T3 transport to target neurons is hypothalamic thyroid hormone uptake from the CSF, with thyroid hormone being taken up from the CSF in the third ventricle and transported by tanycytes to neurons in the ARC that project to TRH cells in the PVN [58]. Upregulation of ARC D2 activity during food deprivation causes increased local bioavailability of T3 in the ARC, leading to increased UCP2 activity and mitochondrial proliferation within the NPY\/AgRP neurons [53]. In Dio2 null mice, food deprivation does not result in the characteristic increase in hypothalamic NPY expression [53], suggesting that D2-driven T3 production is crucial to maintain the normal hypothalamic response to fasting. TSH from the pars tuberalis induces Dio2 expression in the mouse hypothalamus as part of the photoperiodic response, and this may thus increase hypothalamic T3 levels [16]. However, it is currently unknown whether these changes are responsible for photoperiodic changes in food intake. D3 is responsible for the inactivation of T4 to rT3 and T3 to 3′,3′-diiodothyronine (T2) by inner-ring deiodination [59]. D3 preferentially uses T3 as a substrate rather than T4. D3 is predominantly expressed in the adult CNS [60] but is also expressed in the placenta, pregnant uterus, and fetal tissues. D3 mRNA is expressed in the rat hypothalamus and other CNS regions [61]. In the CNS, D3 activity is mediated by levels of thyroid hormone, with higher levels in hyperthyroidism and lower levels in hypothyroidism [61]. Expression of D3 in peripheral tissues is relatively low, but it can be induced in the liver and skeletal muscle of critically ill patients and has been postulated to be responsible for the characteristic changes of reduced levels of TSH and thyroid hormone seen in the sick euthyroid syndrome [62]. D3 may also play a role in the regulation of food intake. Hibernating Siberian hamsters show significant changes in food intake and energy expenditure depending on photoperiod. During short photoperiod days, which would naturally occur during winter months they have reduced food intake and body weight and their core body temperature falls [63]. Expression and activity of hypothalamic D3 is increased in these animals during the same period, causing a reduction in local bioavailability of T3. The reductions in food intake and body weight can be reversed by the implantation of a T3 pellet into the dorsomedial hypothalamus, suggesting that it may be the changes in hypothalamic D3 that is responsible for these effects on energy homeostasis [64]. ","5. SummaryLocal regulation of thyroid hormones in the CNS may physiologically regulate appetite. Switching between the induction of D2 and D3 expression may finely control hypothalamic thyroid hormone concentrations. Further work is now required in order to characterise the pathways by which thyroid hormones regulate food intake. Determining the mechanisms by which thyroid hormones regulate energy homeostasis may aid the development of therapies for the management of obesity.

Thyroid hormone resistance was initially described by Refetoff et al. in 19671). Typically, patients evidence elevated serum levels of free T4 and T3 associated with normal or slightly elevated TSH2). On the basis of the clinical features, at least two different forms of RTH have been described: generalized resistance to thyroid hormone (GRTH), in which patients are asymptomatic with a few clinical signs, and pituitary resistance to thyroid hormone (PRTH), in which patients present with some thyrotoxicosisassociated signs and symptoms. However, there is a wide overlap in the symptoms and signs evidenced by individuals with GRTH and PRTH3). Although the clinical expression of this syndrome is heterogenous, goiter is the most common clinical finding which brings the individual to medical attention3), and the classic features include attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder, delays in growth, and tachycardia1). Resistance to thyroid hormone is generally transmitted in an autosomal dominant manner. However, sporadic de novo cases are also common, although recessive inheritance is rare1). The linkage between RTH and the TRβ gene was elucidated in 19884). Since that time, approximately 100 mutations have been detected in this gene1, 5), which are clustered primarily in hot spots in the T3-binding domain (exons 8, 9 and 10)6-8). In this study, we report the first case in Korea of a woman with PRTH caused by a missense mutation (V349M) in the TRβ gene.","CASE REPORTA 38-year-old Korean woman was referred to us in June 1998, complaining of intermittent palpitation that had persisted for 2 years. Her treatment was initiated under the diagnosis of hyperthyroidism in June 1996 at a primary care clinic, and after a six-month treatment, she discontinued medication. When first seen at our clinic, she weighed 53 kg, her height was 158 cm, her blood pressure was 130\/80 mmHg, and her pulse rate was 90 beats\/min. The patient had no family history of thyroid diseases. The patient's thyroid gland was diffusely symmetrically enlarged, and no thrill, bruit, or exophthalmos was detected. At that time, her thyroid function tests revealed free T4, 2.60 ng\/dL (range, 0.7-1.8); T3, 150 ng\/dL (range, 80-200); TSH, 3.0 µIU\/mL (range, 0.1-4.2); anti-thyroglobulin (TG) antibody, 20.34 U\/mL (<0.3); and anti-microsomal antibody, 11.30 U\/mL (<0.3).After three visits, the patient was lost to follow-up. In December 2004, she visited a primary care clinic, and her thyroid function tests revealed free T4, 2.51 ng\/dL; T3, 163 ng\/dL; and TSH 14.24 µIU\/mL. In February 2005 she received an anti-thyroid drug, methimazole 10 mg, due to suspicion of diffuse goiter. She was again referred to us in July 2005 for further evaluation and treatment for diffuse goiter. Thyroid function tests, which were conducted at a primary care clinic in March 2005, revealed free T4, 1.89 ng\/dL; T3, 224 ng\/dL; and TSH, 33.59 µIU\/mL. We then discontinued methimazole, and the patient was scheduled to take thyroid function tests after one month. Thyroid function tests were conducted one month later, and revealed the following: free T4, 3.53 ng\/dL; T3, 300 ng\/dL; TSH, 3.0 µIU\/mL; and thyroxine-binding globulin (TBG), 23.08 µg\/mL (range, 11.3-28.9). Tests for thyroid autoantibodies revealed TG antibody, 68.04 U\/mL; anti-microsomal antibody, >100 U\/mL; thyroid stimulating immunoglobin (TSI), 0% (<15); and T3 and T4 autoantibodies, negative. Thereafter, the patient was treated with atenolol 100 mg for 4 weeks. Four weeks later, she had no palpitation and her medication was discontinued. Thyroid scans indicated that the thyroid gland was diffusely enlarged, but we noted no abnormal focal lesions (Figure 1). Basal serum TSH levels were abnormally high, and increased to a significant degree after stimulation with 200 µg of TRH (Table 1). The level of TSH -subunit was 0.41 mIU\/mL (range, 0-0.9), TSH α-subunit\/TSH was 1, and sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG) was 39.23 nmol\/L (range, 30-100). MR imaging of the sellar lesion evidenced no abnormal findings (Figure 2). For the next diagnostic plan, we conducted a sequence analysis of the TRβ gene. The result revealed a missense mutation in exon 11 and an amino acid alterationnamely, a substitution of valine for methonine at codon 349 (Figure 3). On the basis of these results, she was ultimately diagnosed with thyroid hormone resistance syndrome, and she has been followed up with periodic thyroid function tests.","DISCUSSIONThyroid hormone resistance syndrome is characterized by elevated levels of circulating free thyroid hormone, inappropriate TSH secretion, and reduced peripheral tissue responses to the activity of iodothyronine. Inappropriate secretion of TSH and the coexistence of elevated serum thyroid hormone and normal TSH levels has been noted in several situations, including abnormal thyroid hormone transport, TSH-secreting pituitary neoplasms, and pituitary or peripheral resistance to thyroid hormones9, 10.RTH is the consequence of mutations in the gene of the thyroid hormone receptor (TRs). The mutant TR interferes with the activity of normal TR to induce the clinical syndrome11). As RTH patients present with elevated thyroid hormone levels and goiter, frequently accompanied by some manifestations of thyrotoxicosis, the condition is often misdiagnosed as Graves' disease. However, exophthalmos has never been identified as a feature of RTH, and thyroid auto-antibodies have been detected only in approximately 4% of patients12). By way of contrast, thyroid hormone hypersecretion as the result of stimulating auto-antibodies (Graves' disease) or hyperfunctioning thyroid tissue (autonomous single or multinodular goiter) is uniformly associated with the inhibition of TSH secretion, resulting in unmeasurable serum TSH levels13).Clinically, thyroid hormone resistance can be divided into two entities: GRTH and PRTH11). Both GRTH and PRTH are rare diseases, occurring at any age and with no sex predilection. In general, diagnoses of PRTH are made largely on the basis of the presence of the clinical signs and symptoms of hyperthyroidism13). Comprehensive assessments utilizing biochemical and physiological indices of thyroid hormone action are useful, but are limited by their lack of precision. Moreover, they also evidence an overlap between the values recorded in cases of GRTH and PRTH11). No differences in the absolute levels of TSH or free thyroid hormone are observed in GRTH patients as opposed to PRTH patients. Stimulatory and inhibitory tests have also been conducted in GRTH and PRTH patients, in order to evaluate the pituitary-thyroid axis in a dynamic manner. The TSH response to TRH is normal, or even exaggerated, and is prolonged in all GRTH and PRTH patients2). A molecular mechanism to explain these two clinical phenotypes has proven elusive, and many authors have concluded that they are part of a spectrum of the same disorder13).TRs belong to the superfamily of ligand-dependent transcription factors. TRs are encoded by the thyroid hormone receptor α gene (THRA) and the thyroid hormone receptor β gene (THRB), which are located on chromosomes 17 and 3, respectively. The expression of TRs occurs in a tissue-dependent fashion. Although THRA1 and THRB1 are expressed ubiquitously, THRA1 is expressed predominantly in the heart, bone, and brain, whereas TRβ1 is expressed more abundantly in the liver, kidney, and thyroid. THRB2 expression is limited to the pituitary gland, hypothalamus, retina, and inner ear, and THRB3 expression occurs principally in the heart and kidney14). One of the most salient reasons for recognizing RTH is that its management differs from that of other common forms of thyroid dysfunction. In addition, discrimination between GRTH and PRTH using clinical criteria remains useful, as the management of the two states differs. Patients with unequivocal peripheral or pituitary resistance should not be treated with antithyroid agents, as any reduction in elevated thyroid hormones may aggravate symptoms, reduce growth and development, and exacerbate goiter. Patients who present with apparent selective pituitary resistance are the most difficult to manage. Many of the patients with peripheral resistance appear to benefit from further increases in serum thyroid hormone levels as the result of cautious exogenous administration of T4 or T3. At a minimum, such therapy tends to reduce serum TSH levels and goiter to some degree15).With the increasing availability of sensitive and specific TSH radioimmunoassys, a greater number of these patients are being detected. It is important to remember that these patients may display only minimal elevation of serum TSH. On rare occasions, TSH may be within normal ranges, but may still be inappropriately high, despite elevated free thyroid hormone levels."],"title":"Resistance to Thyroid Hormone with Missense Mutation (V349M) in the Thyroid Hormone Receptor Beta Gene"},{"documentAbstract":"Resistance to thyroid hormone (RTH) is an autosomal dominant hereditary disorder that is difficult to diagnose because of its rarity and variable clinical features.

to thyroid hormone (RTH) is a rare an autosomal dominant hereditary disorder (1). In the majority of cases, RTH is caused by mutations in the thyroid hormone receptor beta (TRβ) gene. The clinical presentation is variable, but common features include goiter, an absence of the classic thyrotoxic symptoms and metabolic consequences of elevated thyroid hormone levels, and a normal or exaggerated thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) response to thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH). Until now over 1,000 cases have been identified around the world, and nine cases have been reported in Korea (2-9).We recently encountered a case of RTH with incidental micropapillary thyroid carcinoma. The association between RTH and thyroid cancer has not yet been clarified, but there is evidence to suggest that RTH may play a contributory role.Here, we present a case of RTH with thyroid cancer along with the mutation analysis for the TRβ gene.","CASE REPORTA 38-yr-old Korean woman visited a private clinic for the evaluation of anterior neck swelling. The initial laboratory examination revealed an elevated levels of serum thyroid hormone without accompanying TSH suppression (free T4 2.67 ng\/dL [range, 0.64-1.72] and TSH 1.82 µIU\/mL [range, 0.4-4.5]). She had no signs or symptoms of typical thyrotoxicosis except diffuse goiter and mild palpitations. However, due to findings of elevated serum thyroid hormone levels and goiter, she was diagnosed with Graves' disease, and prophylthiouracil (PTU) was prescribed. After three months of PTU (100 mg three times daily), she complained of generalized weakness, a weight gain of about 3 kg, and generalized edema. Consequently, she was referred to our hospital.When first seen at our hospital on December 9, 2008, her height and weight were 162 cm and 49 kg, respectively, with a blood pressure of 97\/68 mmHg and a pulse rate of 96 beats\/min. Her thyroid gland was symmetrically enlarged, and exophthalmos and myxedematous skin lesions were absent. Past medical history was significant for goiter first detected at age 13. At that time, the physician recommended regular checks for thyroid function because of elevated levels of thyroid hormones, but she was lost to follow-up. Her family history included one sister who had a diffuse goiter and a thyroid nodule.The laboratory examination revealed an elevated level of TSH despite an elevated levels of thyroid hormone [total T3 181 ng\/dL (range, 76-190), free T4 2.50 ng\/dL and TSH 10.23 µIU\/mL]. Thyroid autoantibodies against thyroperoxidase, thyroglobulin, and TSH-receptor were all negative. Thyroid ultrasonography (USG) revealed several micro-nodules in both lobes. USG-guided fine-needle aspiration was performed for the nodule which showed suspicious features of malignancy in the right thyroid lobe (Fig. 1), and the cytologic diagnosis was papillary thyroid carcinoma. A 99m technetium thyroid scan showed diffuse enlargement of the thyroid gland with increased uptake (10.1%) (Fig. 2). PTU was discontinued due to TSH elevation and the occurrence of hypothyroid symptoms. After PTU was stopped for one month, hypothyroid symptoms disappeared and thyroid function tests (TFTs) revealed elevated thyroid hormone levels [free T4 2.20 ng\/dL and total T3 141 ng\/dL] and a nearly normal level of TSH (5.60 µIU\/mL).The differential diagnosis at this point was between RTH and a TSH-secreting pituitary adenoma based on the TFTs findings. TSH-secreting pituitary adenoma was ruled out because the patient had no clinical features of thyrotoxicosis, a negative MRI of the pituitary gland, a normal level of the α-subunit of TSH (0.36 mIU\/mL, range, 0-0.9), and an exaggerated response of TSH to a thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH) stimulation test (Fig. 3).Accordingly, genomic DNA was isolated from the peripheral blood leukocytes of the patient with a G-DEX™ Ilb Genomic DNA Extraction Kit (Intron Biotechnology, Seongnam, Korea). PCR amplification was conducted on seven coding exons (from exon 4 to 10) of the TRβ gene. The sequences were analyzed using the computational software ABI 3730 XL (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, USA). A point mutation was detected in exon 9 of the TRβ gene that caused the substitution of threonine (ACG) for methionine (ATG) at codon 310 (M310T). This mutation has not yet been reported in Korea. The patient's sister had normal TFTs and no mutation by DNA sequencing analysis (Fig. 4).Ultimately, the patient was diagnosed with RTH and papillary thyroid carcinoma. She underwent a total thyroidectomy and the pathologic diagnosis was two micropapillary thyroid carcinomas in both lobes (0.4 cm in the right and 0.2 cm in the left lobe). After surgery, she received levothyroxine (L-T4) at 150 µg\/day). After three months of L-T4 therapy, her TSH level was still elevated (TSH 45.1 µIU\/mL) and she complained about symptoms of hypothyroidism; therefore, we increased the dose of L-T4 to 200 µg\/day. After two months, her TSH level decreased to 15.5 µIU\/mL, and most of her hypothyroid symptoms disappeared. Ultimately the dose of L-T4 was increased to 250 µg\/day titrated to achived a TSH level comparable to the preoperative value.","DISCUSSIONInappropriate secretion of TSH and the co-existence of elevated thyroid hormone has been noted in several circumstances, including intermittent administration with L-T4, TSH-secreting pituitary adenoma, and RTH (10). RTH is distinguished from TSH-secreting pituitary adenoma by an exaggerated response to TRH, normal levels of the TSH α subunit, and a normal pituitary gland on sella-MRI. RTH is characterized by reduced clinical and biochemical manifestations of thyroid hormone action relative to the elevated circulating thyroid hormone levels. The linkage between RTH and the TRβ gene was detected in 1988 (11). About 90% of RTH patients carry mutations in the T3-binding domain between exon 4 and exon 10 of the TRβ gene. The majority of previously described mutations were missense mutations that induced single amino acid substitutions.Most patients of RTH are clinically euthyroid, some individuals may appear to be hypothyroid or hyperthyroid. Furthermore, the same subject can manifest signs and symptoms of hypothyroidism in one tissue, while the findings may be suggestive of thyrotoxicosis in other tissues (1). On the basis of clinical features, three different forms of RTH have been described: generalized RTH (GRTH), pituitary RTH (PRTH), and peripheral tissue RTH (PTRTH). GRTH patients, the most common form, appear eumetabolic despite elevated level of thyroid hormones maintained by the hypersecretion of TSH in response to hypothalamic TRH. PRTH patients generally display thyrotoxic. Administration of an anti-thyroid drugs may improve the symptoms. PTRTH patients manifest symptoms and signs of hypothyroidism, despite of normal serum thyroid hormone and TSH levels (12).Treatment of RTH should be aimed at maintaining a normal metabolic status. In our case, administration of anti-thyroid drugs under the misdiagnosis of Graves' disease resulted in an increase in serum TSH and the appearance of symptoms of hypothyroidism, while thyroid hormone levels remained elevated. As expected, large amounts of L-T4 were needed in our patient after total thyroidectomy. Titration should be achieved by assessing tissue responses. Restoration of the preoperative levels of TSH is the recommended target in GRTH.The RTH in our patient was accompanied by two small papillary thyroid cancers. The precise contribution of RTH to thyroid tumorigenesis is not fully understood, but there is evidence to suggest that they may play contributory roles. About 95% of RTH patients have diffuse goiter, and continuous stimulation of the thyroid by excess TSH may be related to the formation of thyroid nodules and the growth of thyroid cancer (13). Previous pathological examinations of the thyroid in RTH cases have revealed hyperplasia of the follicular epithelium, sometimes accompanied by papillary proliferation probably due to continuous stimulation by TSH (12). Not only the effect of thyroid, but the cases of co-existence of pituitary tumor were reported (14). TRβ mutants may also have oncogenic actions. Abnormal expression and somatic mutation at various sites of the TRβ gene have been described in human cancers of the liver, kidney, breast and colon (15-19). Puzianowska-Kuznicka et al. (16) conducted the sequencing of TRβ1 and TRα1 cDNAs. TRβ1 and TRα1 mutations were found in 93.8% and 62.5% of papillary cancer cases, respectively. But no mutations were found in healthy thyroid controls, and only 11.1% and 22.2% of thyroid adenomas had such TRβ1 or TRα1 mutations. Suzuki et al. (20) generated a mouse model (TRβPV\/PV mice) of thyroid cancer that harbored a C-terminal 14 amino acid frame-shift mutation in the TRβ gene.Despite accumulating evidence for a possible role for TR mutants in thyroid tumorigenesis, an elevated rate of thyroid cancers in RTH patients has not yet been observed. It may be that most cases of RTH in humans have heterozygous mutations of TRβ, unlike the TRβPV\/PV homozygous mouse model. Other genetic alterations such as BRAF mutation, which is commonly detected the Korean patients with PTC, may also be required to initiate thyroid cancer. Unfortunately, analyses of BRAFV600E mutation or activities of PI3K could not be conducted in our case.In conclusion, RTH is very rare and easily overlooked, but must be considered in patients who present with goiter and elevated thyroid hormone levels with unsuppressed TSH. Further studies to address the association between thyroid cancer and RTH will shed insight on the molecular and cellular mechanisms of thyroid tumorigenesis."],"title":"Mice with a mutation in the thyroid hormone receptor beta gene spontaneously develop thyroid carcinoma: a mouse model of thyroid carcinogenesis"},{"documentAbstract":"Backgroundβ-blocker treatment\nhas emerged as an effective treatment modality for heart failure.\nInterestingly, β-blockers can activate both pro-apoptotic and anti-apoptotic\npathways. Nevertheless, the mechanism for improved cardiac function\nseen with β-blocker treatment remains largely unknown. Carvedilol\nis a non-selective β-blocker with α-receptor blockade and antioxidant\nproperties. We therefore studied the impact of the effects of carvedilol\nin an animal model of end-stage heart failure.ResultsTo test whether\nchronic treatment with β-blockade decreases apoptosis, we treated myopathic\nturkeys with two dosages of carvedilol, 1 mg\/kg (DCM1)\nand 20 mg\/kg (DCM20), for four weeks and compared them\nto non-treated DCM animals (DCM0) and to control turkeys\n(CON). Echocardiographic measurements showed that non-treated DCM\nanimals had a significantly lower fractional shortening (FS) when\ncompared to CON (68.73 ± 1.37 vs. 18.76 ± 0.59%, p < 0.001). Both\ndoses of carvedilol significantly improved FS (33.83 ± 10.11 and\n27.73 ± 6.18% vs. 18.76 ± 0.59 % for untreated DCM, p < 0.001).\nDCM left ventricles were characterized by a higher percentage of\napoptotic nuclei when compared to CON (5.64 ± 0.49 vs. 1.72 ± 0.12%,\nrespectively p < 0.001).

Furthermore, treatment with carvedilol decreased\nthe incidence of apoptosis in cardiac myocytes from failing hearts\nat both doses. These data suggest that the inhibition of apoptosis\nwith carvedilol may lead to improvement in ventricular function\nand may underlie a beneficial effect of β-blockade independent of\nheart rate

of myocytes is thought to contribute to the progressive\ndecline in left ventricular function and the development of congestive\nheart failure. Recent studies have proposed that myocyte loss in\ncardiomyopathy can occur by apoptosis without an inflammatory response [reviewed\nin [1-3]]. In heart failure,\ngrowth stimulation initially occurs as a compensatory effort to\nmeet chronically altered hemodynamic demands and is mediated by systemic\nand\/or local up-regulation of mediators of adrenergic pathways and\nby various cytokines [4,5]. However, cytokines\ncan be directly toxic to cardiac myocytes and result in increased\napoptotic cell death [3,6]. Local up-regulation\nof angiotensin II induces immediate-early genes, which may lead\nto increased protein synthesis and myocardial hypertrophy or, alternatively,\nmay up-regulate expression of apoptotic proteins (such as p53) in\ncardiac myocytes. The initial increase in circulating norepinephrine\nis thought to maintain cardiac function through inotropic mechanisms.\nHowever, a direct cardiac myocyte toxicity from norepinephrine is\nwell recognized [6,7]. Furthermore, pressure-overload\nand stretch associated release of angiotensin II has been shown\nto induce myocyte apoptosis [8-10].\nIn an elegant paper by Telger et al., it has clearly been demonstrated\nthat cardiac hypertrophy is initially preceded by a wave of apoptosis\nof cardiac myocytes followed by cell growth and a decrease in programmed\ncell death [10]. Apoptosis may,\ntherefore, be the consequence of prolonged growth stimulation (adrenergic\nand renin-angiotensin axes) of adult cardiac myocytes, which are\nterminally differentiated. Similarly, certain cytokines (such as\ntumor necrosis factor) can induce growth as well as apoptosis [11]. As proposed by Telger et al. it is\nbecoming clear that cell growth and programmed cell death are in\nfact two linked processes [10].Over the last five years, β-blocker therapy has become one of\nthe main treatment modalities for heart failure. Of particular interest\nis the use of carvedilol [12-16].\nCarvedilol is a novel multiple-action neurohormonal antagonist.\nIts primary activities are nonselective β-adrenoceptor blockade,\nvasodilatation (mediated through α1-adrenoceptor blockade), and\nantioxidant activity [12]. In many clinical studies,\ncarvedilol has been shown to improve left ventricular function and\nsymptoms in patients with ischemic heart disease or idiopathic dilated\ncardiomyopathy [13-16] and\nto dramatically reduce mortality [17].\nHowever, it remains unclear how carvedilol improves ventricular function\nin heart failure.In an animal model of cardiomyopathy that has many similarities\nto human heart failure, we tested the hypothesis that a reduction\nin apoptosis may be responsible for the beneficial effects of carvedilol.\nAs such, attenuation of apoptosis in the myocardium may represent\na novel and important mechanism that contributes beneficial effects on\nthe myocardium.","ResultsBaseline Characteristics of Dilated Cardiomyopathic AnimalsWe have previously shown that removal of furazolidone from the\nfeed after three weeks results in progressive cardiac dilatation\nand heart failure [18]. At the time of\nrandomization of the DCM group into three groups i.e., DCM0 (no\ntreatment), DCM1 (lower dose carvedilol) or DCM20 (higher\ndose carvedilol), fractional shortening was not different between\nthe groups (p > 0.1). Evidence for severe heart failure was marked\nby significantly reduced left ventricle fractional shortening (controls\n63.67 ± 1.04% n = 34 vs. DCM 11.95 ± 0.59% n = 18, p < 0.001).Effect of Carvedilol on Ventricular FunctionWe investigated the effect of carvedilol by administering two\ndifferent dosages (1 mg and 20 mg\/kg body weight per day) to control\nand DCM turkeys for four weeks. We studied two dosages (pharmacological\nand non-pharmacological) as a difference in dose-dependency for\ncardiac function improvement has previously been demonstrated by\nus with another non-selective beta-blocker [18].\nFurthermore, we wanted to determine if carvedilol might exert beneficial\neffects independent of heart rate effects. The lower dose (1 mg\/kg)\ndid not reduce heart rate. However, the higher dose reduced HR by\napproximately 15% for 8 hours.In vivo contractile performance of the heart was assessed by\nthe determination of fractional shortening of the left ventricle.\nAs shown in Table 1 and Figure 1, fractional shortening was increased\nby 32 and 45% in DCM1 and DCM20 animals, respectively,\ncompared to non-treated DCM animals (DCM0). Compared\nwith baseline values at the time of randomization, the improvement\nin fractional shortening was of 57% in DCM1 and 65% in\nDCM20. Associated with improved cardiac function was\na reduction in the incidence of apoptotic nuclei (see below).Table 1Inhibition of Apoptosis\nby Carvedilol Correlates with Improvement in LV Function.Cont n = 13Cont1 n = 11Cont20 n = 10DCM0 n = 18DCM1 n = 13DCM20 n = 12FS %68.73* ± 1.3766.09* ± 0.9066.99* ± 1.3718.76 ± 1.8327.73* ± 6.1833.83* ± 10.11Apoptosis %1.72* ± 0.122.10 * ± 0.252.20* ± 0.245.64 ± 0.492.32* ± 0.232.36* ± 0.26Fractional shortening (FS%) was calculated from\nechocardiographic images as described in the methods.

Healthy control turkeys (CON); control\nturkeys treated with two dosages of carvedilol, 1 mg\/kg (CON1)\nand 20 mg\/kg (CON20); dilated cardiomyopathic turkeys\n(DCM); non-treated DCM animals (DCM0); myopathic turkeys treated\nwith two dosages of carvedilol, 1 mg\/kg (DCM1) and 20\nmg\/kg (DCM20).The body weight was significantly decreased in DCM animals compared\nto control animals (p < 0.001 compared to control) (Table 2). This animal model is associated with\ncachexia. Carvedilol treatment resulted in a slight gain of body\nweight, 15% in the DCM1 group and 20% in the DCM20 group\ncompared with the non-treated DCM group (DCM0). Carvedilo\nalso increased the body weight of control animals (p < 0.001).\nThese data indicate a favorable effect on cachexia. In non-treated\nDCM animals the hearts weighed significantly less than control hearts\n(p = 0.01). DCM animals treated with carvedilol showed a significant\nincrease in HW compared to hearts from non-treated DCM animals (p\n< 0.001). Therefore the HW\/BW ratio was lower for hearts from\ncarvedilol treated DCM animals compared to hearts from non-treated\nDCM animals. Interestingly, the HW\/BW ratio was lower for carvedilol\ntreated control animals compared to non-treated control animals.\nLeft ventricle volume was significantly larger for non-treated DCM\nhearts. Carvedilol significantly decreased LV volume at both dosages.Table 2Effect of Carvedilol\non Gross MorphologyHW (kg)BW (kg)HW\/BW (%)LV vol (ml)Control (n = 13)0.018 ± 0.0014.36# ± 0.160.4 ± 0.0130.24• ± 0.04Cont1 (n = 11)0.018 ± 0.0015.3# ± 0.140.35 ± 0.0160.37• ± 0.06Cont20 (n = 10)0.02 ± 0.0015.65# ± 0.090.35 ± 0.0080.37• ± 0.04DCM0 (n = 18)0.017 ± 0.0012.61 ± 0.230.64 ± 0.0499.36 ± 2.0DCM1 (n = 13)0.019 ± 0.0013.07# ± 0.290.60 ± 0.056.28• ± 2.54DCM20 (n = 12)0.019 ± 0.0013.26# ± 0.290.58 ± 0.0785.38• ± 1.95HW: heart weight  p ≤ 0.01 compared to non-treated DCM group;\nBW: body weight #p < 0.001 compared to non-treated DCM group;\nHW\/BW ratio  p < 0.04 compared to non-treated DCM\ngroup; LV vol: atria were removed and the left ventricles were arrested\nin diastole and filled with saline • p ≤ 0.008 compared to non-treated\nDCM.

Both in animal and human studies of heart failure, β-adrenergic\nblockade intervention appears to have beneficial effects on cardiac\nmyocyte function [1,23,24]. Of particular\nimportance, studies using carvedilol have shown remarkable improvements\nin cardiac performance [12,13,15,16] and\nreduction in mortality in humans [17].\nWe have previously shown that propranolol, a nonselective β-blocker,\nis cardioprotective and prevents the development of heart failure\nin turkeys when given concurrently with furazolidone [21]. Similarly, carteolol, a nonselective β-blocker,\nresulted in improvement in ejection fraction, reduction in ventricular\nvolumes, an increase in developed pressure as well as an increase\nin rate of survival in our turkey model [18]. Improvement\nin cardiac function was associated with cellular remodeling of cardiac\nmyocytes. Cardiac myocytes from hearts treated with a non-selective β-blocker\ni.e., carteolol, had normal calcium cycling, normal myocardial energetics,\nnormal β1 receptor density as well as regression of myocyte\nhypertrophy and reduced connective tissue content [18]. Furthermore, administration of carteolol has\nbeen reported to prevent the development of virally induced cardiomyopathy\nin a murine model [25]. In a canine model\nwith left ventricular dysfunction produced by multiple sequential\nintracoronary microembolizations, long term treatment with metoprolol,\na β1-selective blocker, has been reported to prevent\nthe progression of LV systolic dysfunction and LV chamber dilatation [26]. Similarly, our present findings on\nthe effect of carvedilol indicated improvement of left ventricular\nfunction and smaller LV volumes. Carvedilol prevented progression\nof LV systolic dysfunction and LV dilatation as previously reported\nin other models using β-blockers [18,26].Animals with dilated cardiomyopathy which received carvedilol\nshowed significant improvement in LV systolic function after 4 weeks.\nNotably, the improvement of LV systolic function in animals treated\nwith carvedilol was associated with a decrease of LV volumes compared\nwith non-treated DCM animals. Importantly, both doses of carvedilol\nimproved LV contractile performance. Fractional shortening (%) was\nincreased by an average of approximately 38% and impressively by\n80% in some individual animals. These data seem to agree with the results\nof human clinical studies, and are suggestive that carvedilol not\nonly slows deterioration of cardiac function, but also improves\ncardiac function.The trend that the 20 mg\/kg body weight dose might not have been\nwell tolerated was demonstrated by some animals becoming moribund\nfor a short period after dosing which might be due to a reduction\nin heart rate and cardiac output with resultant reflect tachycardia.\nWe have previously shown a negative force-interval relationship (i.e.,\nnegative treppe) in failing hearts with this model [18]. This is in line with data from human\nstudies, which showed that when first administered, β-blockers actually slow\nheart rate and diminish ejection fraction [27].\nThe higher dose of carvedilol significantly reduced heart rate and\nblood pressure for up to eight hours. Animals that tolerated the\nhigher dose did nevertheless benefit from the treatment. This is\nsimilar to human clinical studies where greater benefit is derived\nfrom higher dosages, if tolerated [28].Apoptosis in Animal Models of Heart FailureHeart failure is characterized by progressive deterioration of\nglobal left ventricular function over time. The mechanisms responsible\nfor the worsening of cardiac function are not clear. Loss of cardiac\nmyocytes has been suspected to be a feature of the cardiomyopathic\nprocess that contributes to progressive decline in left ventricular\nfunction and the development of congestive heart failure [29]. Evidence supporting the concept of\nmyocyte apoptosis occurrence and contribution in the progression\nof heart failure has been obtained from a variety of observations,\nincluding in vitro studies, experimental animal models\nof cardiac dysfunction, and studies on cardiac tissue obtained\nfrom patients with end-stage heart failure [5,7-9,29].We sought to evaluate the incidence and the extent of apoptosis\nin our animal model of heart failure. Using the TUNEL technique\nas a means of detection, we were able to document the occurrence\nof apoptosis in ventricles from failing hearts, which was characterized\nby a higher percentage of apoptotic nuclei when compared to controls (5.64%\nvs. 1.72%). These apoptotic indexes are within the range of values\nin heart failure reported in the literature (0.2% to 35%) [3,30-33]. The high degree\nof variability reported in the literature in the magnitude of apoptosis may\nbe due to the diversity and specificity of methods used to quantify\napoptotic nuclei.When reporting apoptotic nuclei using the TUNEL assay, two observations\nshould be considered; 1) although apoptosis occurred in our model\nof heart failure, we might have missed, in random histological\nsections, evidence of apoptosis thereby under estimating the severity\nof programmed cell death due to the fact that apoptotic cells undergo\nrapid phagocytosis with the entire process lasting less than two\nhours in some cell systems [34], and 2) apoptosis\nin the present study was evaluated at a single time point when the\nheart was still undergoing LV remodeling. Hence, the documentation\nof apoptosis at this stage may not reflect the true magnitude of\nits occurrence during the initiation and transition to heart failure.\nIn a rat model of pressure-overload hypertrophy produced by aortic\nbanding, apoptosis appeared to peak at four days and gradually subsided\nafter one month of aortic banding [9].\nTherefore, a longitudinal study of apoptosis in failing hearts from\ninitiation to transition to failure is worth pursuing. In this way,\nthe incidence of apoptosis can be documented as the heart moves\nprogressively from normal to compensated hypertrophy and finally\nto overt decompensated heart failure. These animals were in compensated heart\nfailure and, often in the non-treated group, went into decompensated\nheart failure when stressed during echocardiographic examination.With improved cardiac function, there should be a reduction in\nactivation of the adrenergic-renin-angiotensin axes as well as a\ndecrease in activated cytokines such as tumor-necrosis factor-α.\nIn our model of heart failure, cardiac function correlated with\nthe incidence of apoptosis. As described in Table 1 and Figure 3,\nthere were a higher number of apoptotic cells in hearts with a reduction\nin fractional shortening. In contrast, control hearts with normal\nventricular function showed low rates of apoptosis. The extent and\noccurrence of apoptosis may partially explain the lack of an overall\nincrease in heart weight in hearts from non-treated DCM animals,\ndespite a pronounced increase in heart size. These observations,\nand the results from several animal models, demonstrate that apoptotic\ncells are present in failing hearts, suggesting that apoptosis might\nbe a mechanism involved, at least in part, in the progression of\nheart failure and the reduction of myocyte mass.Carvedilol Inhibition of Apoptosis and Improvement of Ventricular\nFunctionThe extent of apoptosis in cardiomyopathic animals was significantly\nreduced by treatment with carvedilol. Both the lower and higher\ndoses of carvedilol were effective in decreasing the rate of apoptosis\n(approximately a 58% reduction). This observation represents an\nimportant finding in demonstrating the effectiveness of a cardiovascular\ndrug to protect against continual cardiac myocyte apoptosis in failing\nhearts in vivo. Furthermore, the inhibition of apoptosis\nby carvedilol was accompanied by signs of improvement in left ventricular\nfunction and heart size (i.e. reduced LV volume) in the myopathic\nanimals. Whether the improved function, small heart size and decreased\nwall stress were responsible for a reduction in apoptosis is not\nknown. However, the derived cardiac benefit was independent of heart\nrate effects because benefit was obtained at both dosages.Our data support the conclusions of Rossig et al. in endothelial\ncells. They reported levels of apoptotic cells for control and\nNYHA III-IV hearts that were similar to our observations [35]. We similarly believe that the suppression\nof apoptosis by carvedilol is likely due to its antioxidative properties\nrather than the β-blocking effects [35]. We\nbase this on our observation that a similar reduction in the incidence\nof apoptosis was seen at both a non-pharmacological (no effect on\nheart rate or blood pressure) as well as a pharmacological dose\nof carvedilol. In a canine model of chronic heart failure produced\nby multiple sequential intracoronary embolizations, metprolol, a β1 selective\nblocker, reduced the incidence of apoptosis supporting our experimental\nobservations with carvedilol [36].\nThe incidence of apoptosis was 5.32 ± 0.77 in heart failure animals\nthat were not treated which is similar to our findings of 5.64 ±\n0.49 in hearts from untreated animals with heart failure. Recently,\nLi et al. have demonstrated that spontaneously hypertensive rats\n(SHR) with symptoms of heart failure had significantly higher levels of\napoptotic myocytes than control myocytes [37].\nWhen treated with an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor, the\nnumber of apoptotic cells in the SHR with symptoms of heart failure\nwas dramatically reduced to control levels; controls were SHR without\nsymptoms of heart failure [37]. Kajstura et al.\nhave also reported that angiotensin II increased the percentage\nof apoptotic cells in isolated adult rat ventricular myocytes, and\nthis effect was mediated by AT-1 receptors [38].\nAlthough ventricular function was not assessed in these studies,\nthe observations raise the possibility that, like our findings with\ncarvedilol, the beneficial effect of ACE-inhibitors or AT-1 receptor\nblockers in heart failure may in part be attributed to an inhibition\nof myocyte apoptosis with a resultant improvement in in vivo cardiac\nfunction, a concept that needs further study.The data presented suggest that attenuation of apoptosis may\nunderlie the beneficial effect of β-blockade on ventricular function,\nand that the inhibition of apoptosis can possibly lead to improvement\nin ventricular function. This represents a novel mechanism to slow\nthe progressive deterioration of myocardial function that can occur\nin patients with cardiac failure. Because reactive oxygen radicals\nplay a role in inducing cell apoptosis [39] and\nthe potent antioxidant property of carvedilol [12], we speculate that the beneficial effects\nattributed to carvedilol (i.e. inhibition of apoptosis and improvement\nof LV function) are mediated, in part, by its prevention of oxygen-derived free\nradical damage [35,40]. Our data supports\nthis idea.Therapeutic SignificanceWith the clear demonstration that cardiac myocyte apoptosis is\npresent in our heart failure model strategies for prevention of\napoptosis can be tested. The clinical consensus has been that higher\ndoses of β-blockade should incur more benefits on ventricular remodeling.\nHowever, our studies demonstrated similar benefits at a therapeutic\nand sub-therapeutic dose. In light of the beneficial effect of carvedilol\non the progression of heart failure, and its unique multi-actions\nthat are not shared by any other β-blocking drug or by any other\nagent currently used in the treatment of heart failure, our findings\nrepresent an important new mechanism of improved cardiac function.The development of animal models of heart failure in which apoptosis\nis an important feature will allow the modulation of cell death\npathways through targeted interventions. Understanding the role\nof specific signaling pathways in cardiac myocyte apoptosis and\ndeveloping strategies to manipulate these intracellular pathways\nmay provide in the near future novel therapeutic approaches for\nthe management of heart failure.","ConclusionsIn conclusion, our model of heart failure, which shows a high\nlevel of congruence with the human condition, has been shown to\nhave a high level of apoptosis that corresponds with cardiac failure.\nCarvedilol, a non-selective β-blocker with α-blocking properties\nas well as antioxidant properties, significantly reduced the incidence\nof programmed cell death while improving cardiac function. This\neffect was independent of heart rate lowering effects, i.e. β-blockade.\nThe beneficial effects of carvedilol can therefore be obtained with\nsubtherapeutic doses. This is a novel observation and important\nin treating patients who may not tolerate higher doses (heart rate\nand blood pressure lowering) of carvedilol. The apoptotic process\nis linked to the development and progression of heart failure as\nwell as the improvement in cardiac function seen with β-blockade.","MethodsExperimental DesignOne day-old broad-breasted white turkey poults, obtained from\na commercial breeder, were wing-banded for easy identification.\nAt seven days of age, they were weighed and randomly divided into\ntwo groups using a random number generator. The control group (n\n= 34) was maintained on a normal ration, free from any additives,\nand the experimental group (n = 91) was fed 700 parts per million\nfurazolidone (Fz) for three weeks. Furazolidone was stopped after\nday twenty-eight and the animals were randomized into three groups:\none group did not receive carvedilol treatment, DCM0 (n\n= 52), whereas the other two groups, DCM1 (n = 19) and\nDCM20 (n = 20), were treated with carvedilol in the same\ndosages as respective aged-matched control animals (see following).\nSimilarly, age matched control animals were randomized into three\ngroups: one group received no pharmacological agent (Con0.\nn = 13), whereas the other two groups received different dosages\nof carvedilol, 1 mg\/kg (Con1 n = 11) or 20 mg\/kg body\nweight (Con20 n = 10). The lower dose of carvedilol did\nnot lower heart rate or blood pressure. However, the higher dose\nof carvedilol resulted in a significant reduction in heart rate\n(15%) and blood pressure (9%) for up to eight hours. We performed\ndose range studies using nine concentrations of carvedilol (data\nnot shown). At the time of euthanasia, body weights, heart weights\n(after removal of the atria), and LV volumes were obtained on all\nexperimental animals.Echocardiographic MeasurementsEchocardiographic views were obtained using a 7.5 MHz transducer\non unsedated and quietly resting animals. Several cardiac cycles\nwere recorded on a videotape and the two dimensional images subsequently\nplayed back for analysis. Diastolic left ventricular internal dimension (LVIDd)\nand systolic left ventricular internal dimension (LVIDs) were also\nmeasured and used to determine the fractional shortening. Fractional\nshortening (%) of the left ventricle was calculated as (LVIDd -\nLVIDs\/ LVIDd) × 100.TUNELRandomly selected hearts from control and cardiomyopathic turkey\npoults were rapidly removed, flushed with PBS and infused with a\ntissue embedding medium (Tissue-Tek, OCT Compound, Miles Inc., Elkhart,\nIN) and frozen in liquid nitrogen. Serial 7 μm cross-sections from heart\nblocks were cut and fixed to coated slides. Frozen heart sections\nwere fixed in 10% neutral formalin (4% formaldehyde) for 10 minutes\nat room temperature and post-fixed in Methanol\/Acetone (1:1) for\n10 minutes at -20°C. Detection of apoptotic cardiac myocytes was achieved\nby direct immunofluorescence detection of digoxigenin-labeled genomic\nDNA using the ApopTag Plus in Situ apoptosis detection kit – Fluorescein\n(Intergen, Purchase, NY). This method used the TUNEL technique\nto stain DNA fragments in nuclei of apoptotic cells. Tissue sections\nwere then counter-stained with Hoechst 33258 stain (1 μg\/ml) (Sigma),\nand viewed with an epifluorescence microscope (Zeiss Axiophot) equipped\nwith filter sets for fluorescein and Hoechst staining. To quantify apoptosis,\nfour to five randomly selected microscopic fields per section were\nexamined. The percentage of apoptotic cells was determined by counting\nthe total number of nuclei and TUNEL positive nuclei (apoptotic\nmyocytes). Samples were numbered to conceal the identity of different\ngroups during counting. Sections of interest were photographed using\na microscope-integrated 35-mm camera.Statistical AnalysisData given in the text are means ± SD. The difference between\nthe means was evaluated using student's t test. P <\n0.05 was considered significant.","Authors' contributionsCCO drafted and edited the manuscript.

Indeed, several prognostic parameters have been identified, including age, New York Heart Association (NYHA) class, renal function, comorbidity such as atrial fibrillation, diabetes mellitus and ischaemic heart disease [1]. In acute decompensated heart failure (ADHF) episodes, the degree of renal dysfunction and arterial hypotension easily stratified patients with the worst clinical outcome [2]. A single determination of brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) plasma level represents a reliable risk stratification procedure and its increase is considered a sensitive diagnostic marker of left ventricular dysfunction [3, 4]. Plasma BNP has clear prognostic relevance in predicting cardiovascular events in congestive heart failure (CHF) patients [5–8] and even in asymptomatic subjects [9].The objective of this study was to analyse different prognostic parameters (renal function, plasma BNP, water composition, echocardiographic and functional capacity) in predicting mid-term clinical outcome in CHF patients discharged after an ADHF episode.","Material and methodsPatientsThis prospective cohort study, approved by the local ethics committees, included patients admitted into the Heart Failure Unit from April 2008 to August 2010. All CHF subjects discharged after an acute episode of cardiac decompensation were enrolled in an out-patient clinic follow-up. Patients were classified as having CHF according to the criteria commonly accepted in the literature [10], namely the presence of 2 major criteria or 1 major criterion + 2 minor criteria according to the Framingham score and NYHA functional class II, III, or IV, due to exacerbation of symptoms with at least 1 class deterioration. The presence of inadequate echo images or no adherence to the therapy and disagreement with the periodical follow-up were considered exclusion criteria. All patients underwent a clinical examination, a 12-lead electrocardiogram, plasma determination of BNP, water composition (on admission and at discharge), 6-minute walk test (6MWT), non-invasive cardiac output and a transthoracic echocardiogram within 48 h upon hospital discharge. The criteria for discharging CHF patients were the following: a) subjective improvement on the basis of NYHA class, with no orthopnoea; b) 90 < systolic blood pressure < 120 mm Hg; c) heart rate < 100 bpm; d) pulse oximetry in ambient air > 90%; e) diuresis > 1000 ml\/day [11] + obtaining normal hydration evaluated with bioelectrical impedance vectorial analysis (see below). Serum creatinine was checked on clinical stability. According to the study protocol, CHF out-patients were checked at 3 and 6 months after discharge. In case of worsening of the clinical status (worsening dyspnoea, body weight increase or oedema, cardiac arrhythmias), a clinical control was provided. The therapy prescribed in those patients included angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (enalapril, ramipril), angiotensin receptor blockade (candesartan, losartan) in case of enalapril\/ramipril intolerance, β-blockers (metoprolol, bisoprolol or carvedilol), digoxin, loop diuretic and spironolactone at low dose. For β-blockers, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockade, the patients’ maximum tolerated dose was used, after an adequate titration period.Doppler echocardiographyEchocardiograms were performed with a Vivid 7 computed sonography system (GE Medical Systems, Waukesha, Wisconsin, USA) according to the recommendations of the American Society of Echocardiography [12]. Two-dimensional apical 2- and 4-chamber views were used for volume measurements; LVEF was calculated with a modified Simpson's method using biplane apical (2- and 4-chamber) views. The left ventricular (LV) end-diastolic volume and the LV end-systolic volume were recorded. All the echo examinations were performed by expert operators blinded to the results of BNP assay; the intra-observer variability in the evaluation of left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) was found to be < 5%. Echocardiographic measurements including LV end-diastolic diameter, and the diastolic thickness of the ventricular septum and the posterior LV wall were determined according to the American Society Echocardiography recommendations [12]. Systolic dysfunction was defined as a level of LVEF < 50%. The definition of restrictive filling pattern (grade 3) was a predefined modification of classifications used in prior studies [13]: E\/A ≥ 2, DT ≤ 150 ms, S\/D ratio < 1, and AR > 35 cm\/s. All these criteria should be verified to define the restrictive filling pattern. The other diastolic filling patterns were classified as: grade 1 (abnormal relaxation) when E\/A < 1 with DT > 240 ms; grade 2 (pseudonormal) when E\/A was 0.75-1.5, DT was 160-240 ms and E\/Ea > 15 [13]. The Doppler sample was set 1-2 mm under the free edges of the mitral valve using the apical 4-chamber projection; an average of 5 beats was considered. In patients suffering from atrial fibrillation at the time of the echocardiogram, the diastolic function was classified as: 1) restrictive pattern (DT ≤ 150 ms) or 2) indeterminate (DT > 150 ms). All these criteria should be verified to define the restrictive filling pattern: ≤ 150 ms, S\/D ratio < 1, and AR > 35 cm\/s. The presence of this diastolic pattern with LVEF ≥ 50% was defined as an isolated diastolic dysfunction.BNP assayAll blood samples were collected by venopuncture and immediately analysed with the bedside Triage B type natriuretic fluorescence immunoassay (Biosite Diagnostics, La Jolla, CA, USA). The Triage Meter is used to measure BNP concentration by detecting a fluorescent emission that reproduces the amount of BNP in the blood. Two hundred and fifty microlitres of whole blood was added to the disposable device, then the cells were filtered and separated from the plasma with BNP, which entered a reaction chamber containing fluorescent BNP antibodies. After 2-min incubation, the BNP-antibody mixture migrated to an area containing immobilised antibodies and remained fixed. The unbound fluorescent antibodies were washed away by the excess sample fluid. Then, the Triage Meter measured the fluorescent intensity of the BNP assay area. The assay results were complete in 15 min. Performance characteristics of the test: assay range 5-5000 pg\/ml; total CV 9.2-11.4%.Non-invasive cardiac outputFor the measurement of non-invasive cardiac output (CO), an inert gas rebreathing method (Innocor, Innovison A\/S, Odense, Denmark) was used. The system utilised N2O (blood soluble gas) and SF6 (blood insoluble gas) enriched with O2 of 0.5% and 0.1% respectively. Tidal volume was progressively increased in the closed circuit to match the physiological increase. Use of SF6 allowed measurement of the volume of the lungs, valve and rebreathing bag. N2O concentration decreases during the rebreathing manoeuvre, with a rate proportional to pulmonary blood flow. Three to four respiratory cycles were needed to obtain N2O washout. Absence of pulmonary shunt was defined as arterial O2 saturation >98% (blood sample obtained from the arterial line). In the absence of pulmonary shunt, pulmonary blood flow=CO. This method was proved to be closely correlated with thermodilution (R=0.93) and the direct Fick method (R=0.94) [14].Six-minute walk testThe 6MWT was performed on the day of discharge according to the guidelines of the American Thoracic Society [15]. The CHF patients able to walk underwent 6MWT if they did not meet the exclusion criteria (unstable angina and myocardial infarction during the previous month, resting heart rate > 120; systolic blood pressure > 180 mm Hg or diastolic blood pressure > 100 mm Hg). Repeat testing was performed after an adequate rest period in order to minimize the intraday variability.Bioelectrical impedance vectorial analysis (BIVA)Assessment of body fluid status was carried out using an electrical impedance analyser and BodyGram 2.1 software (Akern Pontassieve, Florence Italy). The bioelectrical parameters of resistance, reactance and phase angle were obtained with an electric alternating current flux of 800 µA and an operating frequency of 50 kHz. Whole body impedance measurements were taken by using a standard position of outer and inner electrodes on the right hand and foot. The entire procedure was performed according to the indications of the National Institutes of Health Technology assessment conference statements [16]. Bioelectrical impedance evaluates some basic properties of the body by measuring resistance, reactance (a form of opposition that electronic components exhibit to the passage of the alternating current counterpart of direct current and which indicates an absolute amount of body cell mass). Bioelectrical impedance is normally used to estimate the volumes of body fluid compartments allowing one to determine total body water and the ratio between extracellular and total body water. Resistance and reactance were always corrected for the patients’ height. The clinical support of this method has been implemented using vector analysis (Bioelectrical Impedance Vector Analysis, Biavector) [17]. The backward or forward position of parallel vectors to the major axis of ellipses is normally correlated with dehydration or hyperhydration (Figure 1). The normal value of hydration was set at a value 73.3% (nomogram in Figure 1) and the area within +1 SD was considered a satisfactory criterion for discharging CHF patients.Figure 1Evaluation of grade of hydration in CHF patients using the BIVA giagram and nomogram; on the left the same patients at time A presents hyper-hydration (+3 SD) that was reduced after diuretic therapy (point B)Clinical follow-upDeath by any cause, cardiac transplantation and worsening heart failure requiring readmission to the hospital were considered cardiovascular events. Data regarding the occurrence of cardiovascular events were collected from multiple sources in all patients.Statistical analysisContinuous variables were expressed as mean±standard deviation (SD). We used the Mann-Whitney U-test and the Wilcoxon test for the comparisons between samples, while the association between variables was verified with Fisher's exact test. A p value < 0.05 was considered significant. Categorical variables (NYHA class, cardiovascular events) were analysed using the χ2 test or Fisher's exact test. The Cox proportional hazard regression model was used to examine the relationship of clinical variables, BNP levels, and echocardiographic parameters with the incidence of the combined endpoint during the 6 months after discharge (hazard ratio and 95% confidence interval, CI). The hazard ratio for a continuous variable refers to the risk ratio per unit of the considered variable. The BNP levels were evaluated both as a continuous variable and as a categorical variable (based on cut-off values). According to the plasma BNP value, 2 groups were created,<250 pg\/ml and ≥ 250 pg\/ml, in order to evaluate the role of different levels of plasma BNP on the occurrence of cardiac events in the follow-up. Survival curves were estimated according to Kaplan-Meier analysis and compared by the Tarone-Ware test. Analyses were performed using SPSS software for Windows, release 11.0, SPSS Inc., Chicago, USA.","ResultsTwo-hundred and thirty-seven patients with a diagnosis of CHF after an acute decompensation episode entered this cohort study. The mean age was 71.1±10.1 years old (range: 30-89 years old); 64.1% were males (Table I). The main cause of CHF was ischaemic heart disease (42%) followed by hypertensive and dilatative cardiomyopathy (Table I). In 12-lead electrocardiogram, 31% of patients were in permanent atrial fibrillation. On discharge the mean New York Heart Association functional class (NYHA) was 1.9±0.5 and the mean plasma BNP was 401.3±501.7 pg\/ml. Renal function was generally impaired (serum creatinine 1.3±0.8 mg\/dl).\nTable IMain clinical, echocardiographic and functional characteristics of patients with congestive heart failureParametersAll (n=237)Events group (n=34)No-event group (n=203)Age [years]71.1±10.1 (30-89)72±7.970.7±10.4Sex (M\/F) [%]153\/8427\/7124\/79NYHA on discharge1.9±0.5 (1-4)2.1±0.71.94±0.4*\nEchocardiographic parameters LV ejection fraction [%]43.2±16.2 (10-77)33.7±15.744.5±15.8**\n LV end systolic diameter [mm]46.5±23.6 (15-216)85.5±57.953.2±12.5**\n LV end diastolic diameter [mm]57.2±25.6 (24-257)119±16122±17**\n Diastolic filling pattern% (I\/II\/III)55\/23\/2223\/12\/6562\/25\/13BNP admission [pg\/ml]593.4±717.7 (80-5000)943.6±579.8536.4±723.2**\nBNP on discharge [pg\/ml]401.3±501.7 (80-5000)750.2±527.3340.7±474.3**\nSerum creatinine [mg\/dl]1.3±0.8 (0.5-8)1.7±0.61.2±0.8**\nHaemoglobin [g\/dl]12.2±1.9 (7-17)12.5±1.412.2±2Cardiac output [l\/min]3.8±1.1 (1.6-6.4)3.7±1.43.8±0.9Cardiac index [l\/min\/mq]2.1±0.6 (0.9-3.7)1.9±0.72.1±0.5Resistance admission [ohm\/mq]296.4±69.5 (177-517)274.8±59.2303.3±71.7*\nResistance on discharge [ohm\/mq]274.6±64.1 (157-425)259.5±69.5281.4±61.2Reactance admission [ohm\/mq]28.7±8.1 (11-57)28.4±9.528.8±7.6Reactance on discharge [ohm\/mq]27.8±7.5 (13-46)28.7±7.627.4±7.56-min walk test on discharge [m]358.5±108 (80-540)347.1±82.8359.6±110.6Delta NYHA1.04±0.60.92±0.6Delta BNP [pg\/ml]245.1±310.8245.04±599.1Delta resistance [ohm\/mq]5.2±63.37.2±70.3Main aetiology [%] Ischaemic heart disease426755 Hypertension201013 Idiopathic14910 Valvular heart disease241622Other comorbidities [%] Atrial fibrillation313530 Diabetes mellitus345831Treatment [%] ACE inhibitors788076 β-Blockers697067 Angiotensin receptor blockers151614 Digoxin556352 Spironolactone575359 Diuretics929487The values are expressed as mean + standard deviation, unless otherwise specified.Delta NYHA – NYHA discharge-NYHA admission, delta BNP – BNP admission-BNP discharge, delta resistance – resistance admission-resistance discharge.

The mean LVEF was 43.2±16.2%. Mild mitral regurgitation was found in 115 patients (48%), while 40 (16.8%) had moderate mitral regurgitation and 21 (8.9%) severe. The echocardiogram revealed mild or moderate aortic regurgitation in 15 patients (6.3%). Mild pericardial effusion was found in 18 subjects (7.5%), without any signs of haemodynamic significance. All the other clinical, biochemical and functional parameters are described in Table I.The whole population was divided into an events group (34 [14.3%] subjects) and a no-event group (203 [85.7%] subjects) according to the occurrence of cardiovascular events.The univariate statistical analysis demonstrated that patients in the events group manifested a reduced LVEF (p<0.01), increased NYHA class (p<0.05), a higher BNP plasma level on admission but also at discharge (p<0.01) and impaired renal function (p<0.01) compared to subjects in the no-event group (Table I). The water composition analysis demonstrated a higher fluid overload on admission in the event group (p<0.05), a difference that disappeared at discharge after diuretic therapy. No differences were found in terms of non-invasive cardiac output and cardiac index at rest or in the 6MWT (Table I). It should be underlined that 8\/34 patients in the events group were not able to perform the 6MWT because of confinement to bed or presenting a high degree of disability necessitating use of a wheelchair. It should be considered a limitation in the analysis of the test (see below).Moreover, in the two groups no differences in terms of age, aetiology of CHF, or presence of atrial fibrillation emerged. The prescriptions of ACE inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers, and β-blockers showed a high prevalence, also considering the comorbidity (20% suffered from hypertension and 42% suffered from ischaemic heart disease) (Table I); patients were equally treated as regards other drugs (Table I). The amount of variation regarding the in-hospital reduction of plasma BNP (delta BNP; p=0.99) or improved NYHA class (delta NYHA; p=0.3) or, finally, amelioration of fluid overload (delta resistance; p=0.9) did not differentiate between CHF patients who experienced cardiovascular events or not (Table I). The follow-up of this study lasted 408±255 days. During the 14-month follow-up 15 patients (6.3%) died, one (0.4%) underwent cardiac transplantation and 18 (7.6%) were readmitted for CHF (events group); in 203 (85.6%) no events were observed (no-events group).In multivariate Cox analysis only LVEF (p=0.0009), plasma creatinine (p=0.006) and BNP at discharge (p=0.001) were significantly associated with adverse mid-term outcome. Age (p=0.6) and the admission value of plasma BNP (p=0.05) were not significantly correlated with clinical outcome. The Kaplan-Meier survival curves demonstrated that an LVEF < 40 or ≥ 40% and a left ventricular end-systolic diameter (LVESD) of <47 mm or ≥ 47 mm influenced prognosis (p=0.04; log rank 4.2 and p=0.002, log rank 9.15 respectively) (Figures 2–3) and that a stratification according to serum creatinine (< 1.5 mg\/dl, 1.5-2 mg\/dl or > 2 mg\/dl) identified three different event-free curves (p=0.00001, log rank 28.76) (Figure 4). In Figures 5 and 6 the event-free curves are depicted according to the plasma value of BNP at admission or at discharge (value < 250 pg\/ml or ≥ 250 pg\/ml), showing a significant predictive value for the discharge value (p=0.001, log rank 10.7 at discharge, p=0.05, log rank 3.7 at admission). In Figure 7, significantly different event-free curves according to the three diastolic filling patterns (type 1-3) emerged (p=0.0001, log rank 22.44). Finally, adding two parameters (creatinine < or >1.5 mg\/dl and BNP < or > 250 pg\/ml), four different survival curves were obtained (p=0.0001; log rank 21.09), in which the clinical significance of renal function clearly emerged (Figure 8).Figure 2Event-free curves in CHF patients according to the LVEFFigure 3Event-free curves in CHF patients according to the left ventricular systolic diameterFigure 4Event-free curves in CHF patients according to plasma creatinineFigure 5Event-free curves in CHF patients according to plasma BNP at admissionFigure 6Event-free curves in CHF patients according to plasma BNP at dischargeFigure 7Event-free curves in CHF patients according to diastolic filling pattern obtained with transthoracic echocardiography before dischargeFigure 8Event-free curves in CHF patients according to plasma BNP at discharge added to serum creatinine","DiscussionFrom this study it emerged that CHF patients discharged after an acute decompensation had a severe adverse clinical outcome (death, cardiac transplantation and hospital readmission) in 14.3% during a follow-up lasting 14 months. Elderly patients with CHF represent most subjects (70%) admitted to hospitals for acute cardiac decompensation; the length of hospitalization lasts usually >2 weeks in geriatric wards and readmission is frequent [18]. Recently, the OPTIMIZE-HF study [19], which included more than 30 000 CHF patients discharged from 215 hospitals, described a short length of hospitalization (4 days) but a 21.3% rate of readmission within 30 days. The study showed that an early (one-week) outpatient clinical follow-up after discharge resulted in a lower probability of being readmitted within 30 days. Considering the huge number of CHF patients discharged from our hospital, easy and practical prognostic parameters able to predict adverse outcomes are essential in order to allocate our resources correctly.The first strong prognostic parameter in those patients was a plasma BNP value at discharge ≥250 pg\/ml (p=0.001, log rank 10.7). This confirms previous reports [8, 20] in which the pre-discharge values of BNP identified an adverse outcome (death or hospital re-admission) at 6-month follow-up. According to the practical approaches to treating CHF patients published by Maisel [21], there could be identified a ‘wet BNP’ in patients with CHF and fluid overload and a ‘dry BNP’ after optimization of therapy. In our population only the ‘dry BNP’ (at discharge) predicted cardiovascular events, because it identified the real state of neurohormonal modulation due to systolic\/diastolic heart dysfunction and left ventricular enlargement. This was confirmed by the lack of significance of the amount of reduction of plasma BNP during hospitalization (delta BNP), which might be translated as: what matters is not how much the optimized therapy has reduced the BNP of your patient, but what is the value at discharge.The second strong predictor of adverse outcome was renal dysfunction. The presence of a chronic cardio-renal syndrome, recently classified as type 2 of the cardio-renal syndromes [22], has been reported in 63% of patients admitted for CHF [23, 24]. Moreover, the ADHERE registry highlighted that the in-hospital mortality risk increased considerably in patients with urea nitrogen ≥ 43 mg\/dl and plasma creatinine ≥ 2.75 mg\/dl [25]. In our population serum creatinine was higher in the event group (p<0.01) and alone identified (divided into three groups:<1.5 mg\/dl, 1.5-2 mg\/dl and > 2 mg\/dl) three different cumulative survival curves (Figure 4). Moreover, adding data of renal function with discharge plasma BNP, four different cumulative survival curves emerged (BNP < 250 pg\/ml and creatinine < 1.5 mg\/dl, BNP < 250 pg\/ml and creatinine > 1.5 mg\/dl, BNP > 250 pg\/ml and creatinine < 1.5 mg\/ dl, and BNP > 250 pg\/ml and creatinine > 1.5 mg\/dl) (Figure 8), in which there clearly appeared the prognostic significance of serum creatinine > 1.5 mg\/dl. Therefore, this analysis identified a simple and practical combination of two markers for identifying a high-risk CHF patient at discharge for a medium-term follow-up, which should be strictly monitored and controlled in order to avoid adverse clinical outcome. Clinicians whose take care of CHF patients might predict different clinical outcome combining two simple and inexpensive parameters (plasma BNP and plasma creatinine).Finally, this study confirmed the prognostic significance of simple echocardiographic parameters, such as LVEF, left ventricular end-systolic diameter (LVESD) and the diastolic filling pattern. In the ESC Guidelines on chronic heart failure [26], the left ventricle was defined as enlarged when the end-systolic diameter was > 45 mm. In patients who survived a myocardial infarction [27] and in cardiomyopathies [28], LV diameters obtained with M mode had strong value for predicting cardiovascular death in long-term follow-up. In our population, the cut-off of 47 mm for LVESD guaranteed a significant powerful stratification for cardiovascular events. The prognostic role of mitral pattern inflow in CHF subjects was highlighted in the meta-analysis of Whalley et al. [29], in which a mortality rate of 22.7% and an odds ratio for all-cause mortality of 4.36 emerged (average follow-up between 3 months and 5 years). In CHF patients with idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy, the presence of a restrictive filling pattern was associated with a six-fold (OR 6.65) increase in mortality. The mortality rate in post-MI patients with a restrictive pattern in the echocardiogram was 31.8% (average follow-up between 2 weeks and 5 years) with a calculated odds ratio of 4.10 [30]. The presence of a pre-discharge restrictive filling pattern in CHF patients after an acute episode of cardiac decompensation corresponded to a high short-term mortality (14%) and readmission rate (42.4%) [31]. Data obtained in this study underlined the importance of the echocardiographic assessment of diastolic filling pattern in CHF patients, able to differentiate prognosis in type 3 vs. the non-restrictive pattern (p=0.0001; log-rank 22.44) and providing robust prognostic information. Finally, this experience failed to demonstrate clinical predictive value of non-invasive determination of CO or SV (Definition missing) at rest, that might be tested during exercise in order to discriminate exercise limitation due to left ventricle pump failure [32].In conclusion, in CHF patients discharged with bioimpedance evidence of normal hydration after an episode of acute decompensation, plasma BNP ≥ 250 pg\/ml and mild renal impairment seemed to be the strongest predictor of mid-term adverse outcome. Simple echocardiographic parameters (LVEF, LVESD and diastolic filling pattern) might help in determining clinical outcome.In the interpretation of the 6MWT results the complete inability of 23.5% of patients in the events group to perform the test might be underestimated. In fact, Passantino et al. [33] demonstrated that the increase in walking distance was significantly associated with survival in CHF patients who walked < 340 m at baseline, confirming the highly prognostic value of 6MWT in those patients."],"title":"Short-term change in distance walked in 6 min is an indicator of outcome in patients with chronic heart failure in clinical practice"},{"documentAbstract":"BackgroundThe hospital treatment of heart failure frequently does not follow published guidelines, potentially contributing to the high morbidity, mortality and economic cost of this disorder.

Almost three quarters of these admissions are unplanned and worsening heart failure is responsible for half of these admissions [1,2].The Acute Decompensated Heart Failure National Registry (ADHERE) showed that the hospital treatment of heart failure frequently does not follow published guidelines or conform to the Joint Commission on Accreditation of Healthcare Organizations (JCAHO) core performance measures, potentially contributing to the high morbidity, mortality and economic cost of this disorder [3,4]. ADHERE findings also suggested that the wide variations in conformity may reflect differences in training, guideline familiarity, and implementation of tools and systems to ensure that recommended care is provided and documented. Consequently the development of educational and quality improvement programs has the potential to considerably reduce the current variability in care, enhance guideline adherence, and improve outcomes for patients [5].Clinical pathways has become a popular tool to achieve such goals [6-8]. Clinical pathways are a methodology for the mutual decision making and organization of care for a well-defined group of patients during a well-defined period with the aim to enhance the quality of care by improving patient outcomes, promoting patient safety, increasing patient satisfaction, and optimizing the use of resources. They are also developed by multi-professional teams [9]. Despite enthusiasm and diffusion, the widespread acceptance of clinical pathways remain questionable because very little prospective controlled data demonstrated their effectiveness [10-12].The Experimental Prospective Study on the Effectiveness and Efficiency of the Implementation of Clinical Pathways was designed in order to conduct a rigorous evaluation of clinical pathways in hospital treatment of decompensated heart failure.ObjectivesThe primary objective of the trial was to evaluate the effectiveness of the implementation of clinical pathways for hospital treatment of heart failure among a sample of Italian hospitals. Our hypothesis was that the clinical pathways should be more effective than usual care in treating patients admitted in hospital for heart failure and that the clinical pathways should reduce patients' mortality during the stay and that they should improve patients' outcomes at discharge.Secondary objectives were to estimate the efficiency and the appropriateness of the use of the resources associated with the intervention and its effects on other relevant outcomes.The third objective was to define a statistical model able to predict in-hospital death and unscheduled re-admission.A follow up study to evaluate the effectiveness of the intervention after three years from baseline was described in a separate protocol.","Methods\/DesignThe ProjectThe Experimental Prospective Study on the Effectiveness and Efficiency of the Implementation of Clinical Pathways was promoted and funded by the Italian Ministry of Health (Special Programs art. 12 bis D.lgs 229\/99) and Marche Region. The study's Steering Committee defined the study's objectives, clinical topics, scheduling and design. The Regional Healthcare Agency of Marche Region coordinated and gave administrative support to the project and handled patients' data according to the Italian Data Protection act.Study designWe performed a cluster multi-centre randomized controlled clinical trial to evaluate the effect of applying clinical pathways to process and outcome indicators and to the costs sustained to assist the patients with heart failure. We compared the results obtained treating the patients with clinical pathways to the results obtained with the usual care. Since a clinical pathway is not a single intervention to be compared with a placebo but its eventual benefits come from a mix of complex actions that are implemented at the institutional level (appropriate use of practice guidelines and supplies of drugs and ancillary services, new organization and procedures, patient education, etc.), we randomly assigned hospitals, rather than individual patients, to either introduce the pathway or continue usual care [13-17].Forty hospitals based in four Italian Regions were invited to participate to the study (Figure 1). Eighteen hospitals showed interest in the implementation of the clinical pathway for the hospital treatment of heart failure and were assessed for eligibility. Of the eighteen hospitals that asked to implement the clinical pathway for heart failure we selected and randomized fourteen community hospitals. We based the selection on the comparability of their location, patient population, facilities and teaching status (mean bed size of the hospitals assigned to clinical pathways was 245, in the usual care group was 262).Figure 1Flow diagram of the progress of the units through the trial.One hospital was excluded because it did not match with the inclusion criteria (it was a national institute specialized in geriatric hospital care and research) and one hospital withdrew after the project kick off meeting on a decision of the hospital management. To participate to the study the administrations of the hospitals had to be allow the institution to be allocated to either of the two strategies (clinical pathway or current practice) for a 1-year period and to agree not to implement a clinical pathway for the treatment of heart failure if assigned to the usual care group. Two hospitals could not assure do not implement a pathway if assigned to the control group and therefore were not sampled.Study evaluationsThe primary outcome measure is in-hospital mortality. We will also analyze the impact of the clinical pathways comparing the length and the appropriateness of the stay, the rate of unscheduled readmissions, the customers' satisfaction and the costs treating the patients with the pathways and with the current practice along all the observation period. The quality of the care will be assessed by monitoring the use of diagnostic and therapeutic procedures during hospital stay and by the use of key quality indicators at discharge, as reported in previous studies [18-22].

We calculated the sample size needed to detect a statistical difference in the mortality rate. Since in Italy the in-hospital mortality rates range from 5% to 17%, we expected that clinical pathways succeeded to control mortality to 5% to be clinically relevant [23-25]. Based on this goal a sample size of 424 patients (212 in each group) was required for the study to have 80% power at the 5% significance level (two-sided). The sample size calculation was performed according to standard criteria for cluster randomized trials. We adjusted the sample size using an inflation factor of 1.51 to account for the cluster randomization: 7 clusters per trial arm, cluster size of 30 patients, ICC of 0.018 [26-29].At baseline we verified the comparability of the two groups at the admission measuring patients' age, sex, co-morbidities, risk factors and symptoms severity (Table 2). Patients with a current AMI or unstable angina were excluded from the study.Table 2Characteristics of 429 Hospital Patients in the Clinical Pathway and Usual Care Study Groups (demographics, risk factors and disease severity at admission).VariableClinical pathway (n = 214)Usual Care (n = 215)p valueMale gender1021100.50Mean age in years (SD)81.7 (8.3)79.6 (8.5)0.011Admitted fromGeneral practitioner1061090.77Home108106Severity at admissionNYHA II1615NYHA III1171140.87NYHA IV8186Co morbiditiesHypertension1541610.58COPD52580.58Diabetes41380.71Smoking34310.68InterventionThe project started at each hospital with a ground round that showed the project protocol. Each hospital was assigned one methodological leader by the study Steering Committee (physicians or nurses with at least a two years experience with clinical pathways) that assisted local multidisciplinary teams in the development of the pathways and in the project implementation. The composition of each team was different in each institution and included general hospital-based physicians, cardiologists, epidemiologists, pathologists, psychologists, nurses, hospital-based pharmacists, social workers and administrative peoples. The teams were formed on a voluntary base, received a 3 days training in the development of clinical pathways and constructed the clinical pathways over a 6-month period.The teams analyzed their care processes, did research for the best evidences and defined the appropriate goals to satisfy the multidimensional needs of the patients. These results were detailed into protocols and documentation, including the sequence of events and expected progress of the patients over time. The tasks for each professional were defined according to the following care categories: patients' evaluation; education of patients and families; planning of discharge; diagnostic exams; interventions and procedures; consultancies; medical treatments; nutrition; patients' safety [6,11].The clinical pathways were analyzed by the EBM unit of the Regional Healthcare Agency of Marche and they were judged consistent with current recommendations for the diagnosis and the treatment of heart failure. After the validation of the pathways each team educated in its hospital the staff to the use of the clinical pathway and monitored the use of the pathway.Data analysisData were prospectively collected by local staff both in intervention and in control groups (physician and nurses who were trained in two pre-study educational events). We did not use incentives for the local staff.The analysis will be performed by the research team. In addition to common descriptive statistics (Fisher exact and Kruskal Wallis test for categorical and continuous variables, respectively), that will be performed at the cluster level, the differences in the rate of in-hospital deaths and unscheduled admissions across groups and according to each variable under study will be evaluated using random-effects logistic regression, thus accounting for the clustering effect [30-33]. Variables will be included if significant at the 0.10 level (backward approach), with the exception of age which will be forced to entry. The presence of multicollinearity, interaction and higher power terms will be assessed to check final model validity. Patients who died during the study will be excluded from the regression model evaluating unscheduled readmissions because they could not be re-admitted.Statistical significance will be defined as a two-sided p-value < 0.05. All analyses will be intention-to-treat and will be carried out using STATA statistical software, version 8.2 (Stata Corporation, College Station, Texas, 2003).EthicsThe project was exempt from ethical clearance according to the Italian Ministry of Health law number (ex art. 12bis D.lgs 229\/99). Moreover the aim of the study is to improve quality of care through clinical pathways and thus should not imply any risk for the patients affected by the study. It is difficult to imagine that our intervention based on better evidences and appropriate use of technologies and drugs could worsen the quality of care when compared to usual care. So according to other experiences dealing with clinical pathways or implementation of evidence based guidelines in practice we think that a Committee of Research Ethic would not consider it necessary to submit the protocol for approval [34,35].","DiscussionEven though randomized controlled trials are widely accepted as the most reliable method of determining effectiveness, clinical pathways has not been studied sufficiently in this way. Typically controlled trial design is not used in evaluating clinical pathways because the context level adaptation, which is essential for pathways to work, is perceived as inappropriate in the trial design, likely for the difficulty of keeping replicable and recognizable the intervention [36]. According to Hawe we think that a controlled trial design is appropriate to evaluate clinical pathways as well as other complex interventions and that it is possible to standardize the intervention (the clinical pathways) effectively. To this purpose we defined as standard the steps in the change process or the key functions that the elements of the intervention were meant to improve according to each context. Also the definition of the quality care indicators helped. The indicators were driven by the theory and concerned the functions provided by the key elements of the intervention that were based on expected adherence to the same evidences. We think that this strategy based on combining local change standards to the use of shared evidence based indicators kept the integrity of the intervention in each site.Since clinical pathways are made up of various interconnecting parts we have chosen the cluster-randomized controlled trial design because is widely accepted as the most reliable method of determining effectiveness in Health Services Research [37]. As reported in sample size literature in cluster-randomized controlled trial we had difficulties in defining the sample size for the dual nature of the trial that focused both on individuals and clusters. The sample size calculation was based on the number of individuals needed, while the randomization process was based on clusters. Since each additional cluster represented a large proportionate increase in the study size (and in associated costs) it was necessary to find the proper balance between the need to increase the number of the clusters and its organizational costs. According to cluster design the sample size calculation needed to predict not only the expected effect size, but also the anticipated cluster size and ICC and this was difficult because the lack of published data on clinical pathways. However we think that the number of clusters and of individuals included in our sample assured the viability of the trial [27,29,37,38].We had further difficulties related to current Italian healthcare information systems, above all in the method of documenting and collecting data from current sources (clinical records, paper based abstraction tools, etc.). We think that with a more comprehensive information structure for the clinical pathways, data collection would be easier even though the actual process did not affect the quality of the data but only reduced the efficiency of its collection.","List of abbreviationsADHERE: Acute Decompensated Heart Failure National Registry;JCAHO: Joint Commission on Accreditation of Healthcare Organizations;AEP: Appropriateness Evaluation Protocol;ABC: Activity Based Costing;LVF: Left ventricular function;ICD-9CM: International Classification Diseases 9th revision Clinical Modification;ICC: Intra Cluster Correlation;AMI: Acute Myocardial Infarction;EBM: Evidence Based Medicine.","Competing interestsThe author(s) declare that they have no competing interests.","Authors' contributionsMP conceived and developed this study and wrote the manuscript.

Since the pivotal role of β1 adrenergic receptor (β1-AR) in HF, many publications have studied the associations between the β1-AR polymorphisms (Ser49Gly and Arg389Gly) and HF, with inconsistent results. Thus, we performed a meta-analysis of studies to evaluate the impact of β1-AR polymorphisms on susceptibility to HF, the response to β-blocker therapy and the prognosis of HF.Methods and ResultsElectronic databases were systematically searched before August 2011. We extracted data sets and performed meta-analysis with standardized methods. A total of 27 studies met our inclusion criteria. It was found that in East Asians, the Gly389 allele and Gly389 homozygotes significantly increased the HF risk, while the Gly389 allele and Gly389 homozygotes trended to decrease the risk of HF in whites. With the similar reduction of heart rate, overall, the Arg389 homozygotes showed a better response to β-blocker therapy. Furthermore, the Arg389 homozygotes were significantly associated with better LVEF improvement in East Asians and a mixed population. And in white people, the Arg389 homozygotes made a greater LVESd\/v improvement and trended to be associated with better LVEDd\/v improvement. However, the prognosis of Arg389 homozygotes HF patients was similar to those with Gly389 carriers. The Ser49Gly polymorphism did not impact the risk or prognosis of HF.ConclusionBased on our meta-analysis, the Gly389 allele and Gly389 homozygotes were risk factors in East Asians while trending to protect whites against HF. Furthermore, Arg389 homozygote is significantly associated with a favorable response to β-blocker treatment in HF patients. However, neither of the two polymorphisms is an independent predictor of the prognosis of HF.","pmid":"22815685","ranges":[{"attribute":"Title[0]","begin":56,"end":63},{"attribute":"Title[0]","begin":50,"end":55},{"attribute":"Title[0]","begin":0,"end":4},{"attribute":"Abstract[0]","begin":50,"end":57},{"attribute":"Abstract[0]","begin":44,"end":49},{"attribute":"Abstract[0]","begin":981,"end":986},{"attribute":"Abstract[0]","begin":1771,"end":1780},{"attribute":"Abstract[0]","begin":168,"end":172},{"attribute":"Sections[0]","begin":18,"end":25},{"attribute":"Sections[0]","begin":264,"end":271},{"attribute":"Sections[0]","begin":0,"end":17},{"attribute":"Sections[0]","begin":59,"end":64},{"attribute":"Sections[0]","begin":258,"end":263},{"attribute":"Sections[0]","begin":245,"end":254},{"attribute":"Sections[0]","begin":927,"end":936},{"attribute":"Sections[0]","begin":1121,"end":1130},{"attribute":"Sections[0]","begin":1703,"end":1712},{"attribute":"Sections[0]","begin":1093,"end":1097},{"attribute":"Sections[0]","begin":301,"end":315},{"attribute":"Sections[1]","begin":186,"end":193},{"attribute":"Sections[1]","begin":579,"end":586},{"attribute":"Sections[1]","begin":2817,"end":2824},{"attribute":"Sections[1]","begin":180,"end":185},{"attribute":"Sections[1]","begin":573,"end":578},{"attribute":"Sections[1]","begin":1082,"end":1087},{"attribute":"Sections[1]","begin":1699,"end":1704},{"attribute":"Sections[1]","begin":2811,"end":2816},{"attribute":"Sections[2]","begin":2860,"end":2875},{"attribute":"Sections[2]","begin":3569,"end":3576},{"attribute":"Sections[2]","begin":2258,"end":2271},{"attribute":"Sections[2]","begin":3563,"end":3568},{"attribute":"Sections[2]","begin":3769,"end":3774},{"attribute":"Sections[2]","begin":10454,"end":10459},{"attribute":"Sections[2]","begin":10549,"end":10554},{"attribute":"Sections[2]","begin":11136,"end":11141},{"attribute":"Sections[2]","begin":14870,"end":14875},{"attribute":"Sections[2]","begin":2397,"end":2409},{"attribute":"Sections[2]","begin":2597,"end":2606},{"attribute":"Sections[2]","begin":10724,"end":10733},{"attribute":"Sections[2]","begin":2746,"end":2757},{"attribute":"Sections[2]","begin":2963,"end":2980},{"attribute":"Sections[2]","begin":1404,"end":1418},{"attribute":"Sections[2]","begin":2502,"end":2518},{"attribute":"Sections[3]","begin":5535,"end":5541},{"attribute":"Sections[3]","begin":5593,"end":5599},{"attribute":"Sections[3]","begin":1650,"end":1657},{"attribute":"Sections[3]","begin":2141,"end":2148},{"attribute":"Sections[3]","begin":3453,"end":3460},{"attribute":"Sections[3]","begin":5876,"end":5883},{"attribute":"Sections[3]","begin":6530,"end":6537},{"attribute":"Sections[3]","begin":8031,"end":8038},{"attribute":"Sections[3]","begin":8628,"end":8635},{"attribute":"Sections[3]","begin":521,"end":526},{"attribute":"Sections[3]","begin":1644,"end":1649},{"attribute":"Sections[3]","begin":2135,"end":2140},{"attribute":"Sections[3]","begin":3447,"end":3452},{"attribute":"Sections[3]","begin":4527,"end":4532},{"attribute":"Sections[3]","begin":5870,"end":5875},{"attribute":"Sections[3]","begin":6524,"end":6529},{"attribute":"Sections[3]","begin":6856,"end":6861},{"attribute":"Sections[3]","begin":8025,"end":8030},{"attribute":"Sections[3]","begin":8622,"end":8627},{"attribute":"Sections[3]","begin":9353,"end":9358},{"attribute":"Sections[3]","begin":390,"end":399},{"attribute":"Sections[3]","begin":903,"end":912},{"attribute":"Sections[3]","begin":1427,"end":1436},{"attribute":"Sections[3]","begin":4642,"end":4651},{"attribute":"Sections[3]","begin":5137,"end":5146},{"attribute":"Sections[3]","begin":9894,"end":9903},{"attribute":"Sections[3]","begin":875,"end":879},{"attribute":"Sections[3]","begin":1285,"end":1289},{"attribute":"Sections[3]","begin":2354,"end":2358},{"attribute":"Sections[3]","begin":3139,"end":3143},{"attribute":"Sections[3]","begin":3755,"end":3759},{"attribute":"Sections[3]","begin":5605,"end":5609},{"attribute":"Sections[3]","begin":7233,"end":7237}],"sections":["IntroductionHeart failure (HF) is the end-stage of various heart diseases, and it represents a major health problem owing to its high prevalence, morbidity, mortality and significant health-care costs [1]–[2]. β-blockers are mainstay of current treatment of heart failure (HF) in guideline, for their administration has beneficial effects on left ventricular (LV) function and prognosis [1]–[7]. However, in clinical practice, the response to β-blocker therapy and prognosis of HF are variable among patients. The purpose of diagnosing and treating HF is bringing about a reduction of mortality and morbidity. It is therefore important to identify the risk factors for HF so that preventive measurements can be undertaken early; and anticipation the response to β-blockers would help the physicians to make therapeutic decision. Thus there are needs for risk stratification tools of HF and predictors of response to β-blockers treatment, which are still challenges in the real world.As the targets of endogenous catecholamines and β-blockers, β1 adrenergic receptor is known to play a pivotal role in the progression and treatment of HF [8]. Two common functional polymorphisms of the β1-AR, Ser49Gly and Arg389Gly have been considered as predictors of susceptibility to HF, response to β-blockers therapy and even prognosis of HF in some publications. However, being limited by small sample size, the results are controversial. Thus, we performed this meta-analysis of all the available studies to evaluate the impacts of β1 AR polymorphisms on susceptibility to HF, response to β-blocker therapy, and prognosis. It may provide information for further investigation on individualized HF prevention and treatment.","MethodsSearch and Selection ProcessElectronic searches by PubMed, Cochrane Library, and Chinese Biomedical Disc were used to identify published articles on β1 AR polymorphisms and heart failure. We combined search terms for “β1 receptor genetic polymorphism”, “ADRB1 polymorphism”, “Ser49Gly”, “Arg389Gly”, and all of the studies were published before August 2011. When more than one of the same patient population was included in several publications, only the most recent or complete study was identified in this meta-analysis.Inclusion CriteriaFor the susceptibility to heart failure: (1) case–control studies, (2) evaluating the association between the β1 adrenergic receptor genetic polymorphisms and HF risk, (3) the diagnosis of HF was made according to the World Health Organization criteria, based on the presence of the typical clinical signs and symptoms of HF with left ventricular dysfunction.Response to β-blockers therapy: (1) The definition of HF was based on the World Health Organization criteria, (2) evaluation of β1 AR genetic polymorphisms on the reduction of heart rate (ΔHR), the changes of left ventricular ejection fraction (ΔLVEF), left ventricular end-diastolic diameter\/volume (ΔLVEDd\/v), left ventricular end-systolic diameter\/volume (ΔLVESd\/v), with at least 3 months follow up, (3) all the patients received β-blockers therapy, other medicines such as ACEI\/ARB, diuretics, spironolactone, and digoxin were used when necessary.β1 AR polymorphisms and HF prognosis: (1) The definition of HF was based on the World Health Organization criteria, (2) evaluation of β1 adrenergic receptor genetic polymorphisms on all-cause mortality or combined end-point including death, heart transplantation and hospitalization, (3) patients were followed up for more than 1 year.All the searches were restricted to articles in English or Chinese. Case reports, editorials, and review articles were excluded.Data ExtractionTwo reviewers independently extracted data from published sources. The following information was extracted from each study: the first author, publication year, study design, ethnicity, sample size, distribution of genotypes, Hardy -Weinberg equilibrium (HWE) in controls, the parameters of therapy response (ΔHR, ΔLVEF, ΔLVEDd\/v, and ΔLVESd\/v), and the occurrence of death and combined end-point. We did not define any minimum number of subjects as required to include a study in our meta-analysis. If necessary data could not be extracted, the study authors were contacted by e-mail, with a reminder after 30 days. Disagreements were resolved by joint review and consensus.StatisticsCochrane collaboration meta-analysis review methodology was used for this study [9]. The allele contrast, the recessive and dominant models were evaluated for association between the risk of heart failure and the β1 AR polymorphisms. In addition to the overall analysis, subgroup analysis for each ethnicity was also performed. Ethnicity was categorized into 3 main groups: (1) white descents, (2) East Asian descents, and (3) black descents. The distribution of the genotypes in the control group was tested for Hardy–Weinberg equilibrium [9], a P<0.05 was considered that the distribution of genotypes in the control group deviated from HWE. Studies with controls not in HWE were subjected to a sensitivity analysis.In the meta-analysis of influence on HF patients therapy response and prognosis, comparisons of therapy response parameters (ΔHR, ΔLVEF, ΔLVEDd\/v, ΔLVESd\/v) and prognosis (mortality and combined end-point) between Gly49 carriers (Gly49Gly + Ser49Gly) and Ser49 homozygotes, Gly389 carriers (Gly389Gly + Arg389Gly) and Arg389 homozygotes were carried out respectively.The analysis was carried out using Review Manager statistical software (RevMan version 5.0.2; The Nordic Cochrane Center, Regshospitalet). Pooled relative risk (RR) and associated 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated for the risk and prognosis of HF. The therapy response was evaluated with weighted mean difference (WMD) for ΔHR and ΔLVEF, or standardized mean difference (SMD) for ΔLVEDd\/LVEDv, ΔLVESd\/LVESv. All tests and CIs were 2-sided, and a P<0.05 was considered statistically significant.The presence of heterogeneity across studies was evaluated. The fixed-model (Mantel–Haenszel) was used when smaller heterogeneity were available (Ph <0.1), otherwise the random model (DerSimonian and Laird) was used [11]. Heterogeneity was assessed with I2 test, which described the proportion of variation in the log RR that is attributable to genuine differences across studies rather than to random error. I2 took values between 0% and 100% with higher values denoting greater degree of heterogeneity (I2 = 0% to 25%: no heterogeneity; I2 = 25% to 50%: moderate heterogeneity; I2 = 50% to 75%: large heterogeneity; I2 = 75% to 100%: extreme heterogeneity). Publication bias was assessed using a funnel plot of effect size against standard error.","ResultsEligible StudiesA total of 345 potentially eligible studies were identified, of which 291 were excluded after reviewing the study abstracts. The retrieved studies were then read in their entirety to assess their appropriateness for inclusion in the meta-analysis. As shown in Table 1, fourteen studies were included for relationship between β1 AR polymorphisms and susceptibility to HF [12]–[25], while 8 studies evaluated the impact of β1 AR polymorphisms on HF therapy response to β-blocker [16], [26]–[32], and 10 studies provided information on association between prognosis and β1 AR polymorphisms [12], [15], [19], [29], [32]–[38].

The causes of HF were various, including idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy (IDCM), hypertension and ischemic cardiomyopathy. Controls were mainly healthy population, and matched for area and ethnicity. Genotypes were determined by polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP) in all the publications. Studies were conducted in various populations of racial descent: 7 studies for whites, 4 involved East Asians, 1 study for blacks, 1 involved Mexicans, and 1 study was mixed. The distribution of genotypes in the control group deviated from HWE in 2 studies for Ser49Gly [12], [25], and then a sensitivity analysis was carried out excluding these studies to avoid possible genotyping errors and\/or population stratification.

In general population, the Arg389Gly polymorphism was not significantly associated with HF for all genetic models, the heterogeneity among studies was significant (Gly vs. Arg: Ph = 0.01, I2 = 52%). In subgroup analysis by ethnicity, in East Asians Gly389 allele increased the susceptibility to HF (RR = 1.10; 95% CI: 1.01–1.19, P = 0.03), and Gly389 homozygote was significantly associated with a 35% increased risk of HF compared with Arg389 carrier (RR = 1.35; 95% CI: 1.16–1.57, P<0.01); in contrast, Gly389 allele (RR = 0.94; 95% CI: 0.89–1.00, P = 0.06) and Gly389 homozygote (RR = 0.84; 95% CI: 0.71–1.00, P = 0.05) trend to decrease the risk of HF in whites. Among blacks, there was not a significant relationship between the Arg389Gly polymorphism and HF.10.1371\/journal.pone.0037659.t003Table 3RRs and Heterogeneity Results for the Genetic Contrasts of Arg389Gly and Ser49Gly β1 AR Polymorphisms for HF.PolymorphismEthnicityRR (95% CI)StudiesI2, %PhOverall effect, PArg389GlyGly vs. ArgAll1.01 (0.95, 1.08)14520.010.66Asian1.10 (1.01, 1.19)4260.250.03White0.94 (0.89, 1.00)7380.140.06Black1.00 (0.91, 1.10)200.50.98Gly389 carrier vs. Arg389ArgAll1.00 (0.93, 1.08)14410.050.98Asian1.05 (0.95, 1.17)4350.20.31White0.95 (0.88, 1.03)7340.170.19Black0.98 (0.86, 1.12)200.840.77Gly389Gly vs. Arg389 carrierAll1.08 (0.93, 1.24)14500.010.31Asian1.35 (1.16, 1.57)400.480.0001White0.84 (0.71, 1.00)700.460.05Black1.05 (0.87, 1.27)2500.160.62Ser49GlyGly vs. SerAll1.22 (1.04, 1.43)880<0.010.02Sensitivity1.11 (0.97, 1.27)6510.070.13Asian1.18 (1.06, 1.31)2440.180.003White1.34 (0.95, 1.90)490<0.010.1Gly49 carrier vs. Ser49SerAll1.33 (1.03, 1.72)8520.040.03Sensitivity1.25 (0.94, 1.66)6480.080.12Asian1.24 (0.72, 2.13)2640.090.44White1.48 (0.86, 2.57)4720.010.16Gly49Gly vs. Ser49 carrierAll1.24 (0.74, 2.08)881<0.010.42Sensitivity1.03 (0.76, 1.39)600.840.86Asian1.72 (0.95, 3.12)2690.070.07White1.08 (0.73, 1.62)400.760.69For the Ser49Gly polymorphism, overall, the heterogeneity among studies was significant (Ph<0.01, I2 = 80%). The Gly49 allele significantly increased HF risk (RR = 1.22; 95% CI: 1.04–1.43, P = 0.02) compared with Ser49, while Gly49 carrier had significantly higher risk of HF than Ser49Ser homozygote (RR = 1.33; 95% CI: 1.03–1.72, P = 0.03). But neither of the associations was significant in sensitivity analysis. In ethnicity subgroup analysis, Gly49 significantly increased HF risk compared with Ser49 (RR = 1.18; 95% CI: 1.06–1.31, P<0.01) in East Asians, however, it was not robust either. No association between the risk of HF and Ser49Gly polymorphism was found in whites.β1 AR Polymorphisms and Response to β-blocker TherapyEight studies [16], [26]–[32] evaluated the impact of β1 AR polymorphisms on response to β-blocker therapy: 2 involved East Asians, 3 studies for whites, and 3 studies were mixed (Americans, mainly composed of blacks and Caucasians). ΔHR and parameters of LV remodeling (ΔLVEF, ΔLVEDd\/v, and ΔLVESd\/v) were used to assess the response to β-blocker therapy with at least 3 months follow up. All the 1561 patients with a LVEF ≤45% received concomitant drug therapy, which included β-blocker, angiotensin converting-enzyme (ACE) inhibitor (or an angiotensin receptor blocker if the ACE inhibitor was not tolerated), spironolactone, digoxin, duretics and so on. The kinds of β-blockers were various, comprised selective β1-blockers (metoprolol, bisoprolol) and non-selective β-blockers (carvidilol, bucindolol). And the dose of β-blockers was the target dose according to guideline or a maximum tolerated dose. The LVEF, LVEDd\/v and LVESd\/v were measured with echocardiogram or radionuclide ventriculography.Five studies [16], [26], [29]–[31] including 1056 patients provide information on the reduction of heart rate after β-blocker therapy. There was not a significant difference in the reduction of heart rate between Arg389 homozygotes and Gly389 carriers (WMD = −0.47, 95% CI: −1.65–0.71, P = 0.43, Figure 2A). Even in different ethnics, the HR reductions with β-blockers treatment were comparable in the Arg389 homozygotes and Gly389 carriers.10.1371\/journal.pone.0037659.g002Figure 2Arg389 homozygotes vs. Gly389 carriers in different ethnics: the response to β-blockers.(A) the reduction of HR; (B) the improvements of LVEF; (C) the improvements of LVEDd\/v; (D) the improvements of LVESd\/v.

Eight studies [16], [26]–[32] containing 1602 patients indicated that the improvement of LVEF was better in Arg389 homozygotes (WMD = 1.83, 95% CI: 0.72–2.94, P<0.01, Figure 2B). And another meta-analysis including 4 studies [16], [26], [27], [29] and 477 patients showed that the LVEDd\/v improvement of Arg389 homozygotes trended to be better than Gly389 carriers (SMD = −0.16, 95% CI = −0.35–0.02, P = 0.07, Figure 2C). And it was also found that the LVESd\/v improvement of Arg389 homozygotes was significantly greater than Gly389 carriers (SMD = −0.20, 95% CI: −0.36– −0.04, P = 0.01, Figure 2D) from a meta-analysis of 5 studies [16], [26], [27], [28], [29] and 633 patients.In further subgroup analysis, it was found that the Arg389 homozygotes were associated with a better LVEF improvement in East Asians (WMD = 2.63, 95% CI: 1.85–3.40, P<0.01, Figure 2B) and mixed population (WMD = 1.81, 95% CI: 0.72–2.91, P<0.01, Figure 2B); while among white patients, the Arg389 homozygotes made a better improvement of LVESd\/v (SMD = −0.24, 95% CI = −0.46– −0.01, P = 0.04, Figure 2D) and also a trend of better improvement of LVEDd\/v (SMD = −0.19, 95% CI = −0.41–0.03, P = 0.09, Figure 2C ).In another subgroup analysis, the LVEF improvement of Arg389 homozygotes was significantly greater than Gly389 carriers (SMD = 2.08, 95% CI: 0.94–3.22, P<0.01, Figure 3) in patients treated with selective β1-blockers, but non-selective β-blockers did not achieve different LVEF improvements between Arg389 homozygotes and Gly389 carriers (SMD = 1.90, 95% CI: −0.46–4.26, P = 0.11, Figure 3).10.1371\/journal.pone.0037659.g003Figure 3Arg389 homozygotes vs. Gly389 carriers with selective or non-selective β-blockers: the improvements of LVEF.Gly389 carrier: including Arg389Gly and Gly389 homozygotes; CI: confidence interval; LVEF: left ventricular ejection fraction.β1 AR Polymorphisms and Prognosis of HFA total of 10 studies evaluated the impact of β1 AR polymorphisms on HF mortality and\/or combined endpoint incidence. In 2 of them, the kind of β-blocker was fixed (BEST research: bucindolol, MERIT-HF: metoprolol CR\/XL). Patients in the other 8 studies were mostly treated with β-blockers (at least 70%), and the kinds and dose of β-blockers (metoprolol, bisoprolol, carvidilol and other β-blocker) were decided by the subjects’ physicians. The patients were mostly whites in the 10 studies, in which the causes of HF were various (ischemic\/IDCM\/hypertension).There was no significant difference between Arg389 homozygotes and Gly389 carriers in all-cause mortality (RR = 1.07; 95% CI: 0.94–1.21, P = 0.29, Figure 4A) or combined end-point (RR = 1.05; 95% CI: 0.95–1.16, P = 0.37, Figure 4B). And all-cause mortality of Ser49 homozygotes was not significantly different with Gly49 carriers (RR = 1.36; 95% CI: 0.93–2.01, P = 0.12, Figure 4C), so it was with the combined end-point (RR = 0.94; 95% CI: 0.61–1.44, P = 0.76, Figure 4D).10.1371\/journal.pone.0037659.g004Figure 4Impact of β1-AR polymorphisms on prognosis of HF.(A) Arg389 homozygotes vs. Gly389 carriers: all-cause mortality; (B) Arg389 homozygotes vs. Gly389 carriers: combined end-points; (C) Ser49 homozygotes vs. Gly49 carriers: all-cause mortality; (D) Ser49 homozygotes vs. Gly49 carriers: combined end-points.

And the pooled RRs were not significantly altered, indicating that the results were robust.Publication BiasBegg’s funnel plots were performed to access the publication bias of susceptibility to HF, response to β-blocker therapy and prognosis of HF. The funnel plots appeared symmetric, suggesting the absence of publication bias (data not shown).","DiscussionThe purpose of diagnosing and treating HF is bringing about a reduction of mortality and morbidity. Preventive measurements can be undertaken early according to the risk factor for the development of HF, while appropriate therapeutic decision would be made by accurate prediction of response to β-blockers. Therefore, predictors of susceptibility to HF and response to β-blockers treatment are needed in clinical practice. Sustained sympathetic system activation has been shown to be deleterious to the failing heart, and the transmitters of this system, adrenaline and noradrenaline act on β-receptors situated on cardiomyocytes, which are mostly of the β1-subtype [8]. The β-blockers recommended by the guidelines – metoprolol, bisoprolol, carvidilol can block β1- receptors as their common function [1], [2]. Therefore, the β1 adrenergic receptor plays decisive role in the development and treatment of HF. In vitro and in vivo experiments showed that agonist-related downregulation in Gly49 variant was significantly greater than Ser49 [39]. It was also found that Arg389 receptor would have a greater agonist-promoted coupling to Gs\/adenylyl cyclase compared with Gly389 [40], and β1 AR Arg389 desensitized more rapidly than the Gly389 variant [41]. Since the important role of β1 AR in HF, it was inferred that the two functional polymorphisms would predict the susceptibility to HF, the response to β-blockers treatment, and even the prognosis of HF. However, there was no large scale study to verify the relationship.We have performed a meta-analysis on the impact of β1 adrenergic receptor polymorphisms on susceptibility to heart failure, response to β-blocker therapy and HF prognosis, including data on over 7000 patients and 3000 healthy controls. It has been found that Gly389 allele and Gly389 homozygote increased the risk of HF in East Asians, but trended to decrease the risk of HF in whites. Overall the response to β-blockers in Arg389 homozygote was greater than that in Gly389 carrier while the reductions of HR were similar. But the Arg389 homozygotes did not confer a significant prognosis benefit in heart failure patients. The Ser49Gly polymorphism was associated with neither risk nor prognosis of HF.There was evidence in transgenic mice to show that Arg389 allele was a risk factor of HF [42], while there may be a role for the Ser49Gly polymorphism in the susceptibility to HF [43]. In the present meta-analysis, Gly49 allele increased the HF risk in the general population and in East Asians, but the result was not robust in sensitivity analysis. In the studies with the controls not in HWE, the lack of HWE indicates genotyping errors, population stratification, and selection bias, which could be potential sources of biases [9]. Recently, a meta-analysis [44] found that the Gly389Gly significantly increased risk of idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy (IDCM) in Asians, which consisted with our result. But in that study, Arg389Gly was not associated with susceptibility to IDCM in Europeans. In our study, the causes of HF included IDCM, hypertension and ischemic cardiomyopathy. The important role of Arg389Gly in essential hypertension [45] and LV remodeling in patients following acute myocardial infarction (AMI) [46] could explain that Arg389Gly polymorphism affected the risk of HF but did not associate with susceptibility to IDCM in whites.Furthermore, as a complex pathophysiological process, heart failure was involved in multi-genetic effection, thus other functional genes that affected the susceptibility to HF may mask the influence of β1 adrenergic receptor polymorphisms in different ethnics. In addition, environmental interactions (e.g., smoking, physical activity, and diet) may also play a role in the pathogenesis of HF [47]. In the future, the polymorphisms within haplotypes combined with environmental interactions can be a risk stratification tool of HF rather than the individual polymorphism.Experiments in mice and healthy volunteers showed that the reduction of HR to β-blocker in Arg389 homozygotes was greater than that in Gly389 carriers [43], [48]. However, in our meta-analysis the reductions of HR were comparable, which might be related with the downregulation of myocardial β1 AR in HF patients. While the improvements of LVEF and LVESd\/v were significantly better in Arg389 homozygotes, which also performed a trend for greater reduction of LVEDd\/v. In clinic practice, doctors treat the patient would titrate β-blockers to achieve appropriate heart rate reduction. According to the results, Arg389Gly polymorphism may be a predictor of response to β-blocker treatment in HF patients, which is independent of HR. These findings would be useful in making individualized therapeutic decision in the future.In another subgroup analysis, the Arg389 homozygotes performed a greater LVEF improvement to selective β1-blockers therapy than Gly389 carriers, but no differences were conferred by genotypes in the patients treated with non-selective β-blockers, as non-selective β-blockers also block β2 and α1 AR. The LVEF is an important indicator of response to treatment. Blockade of the β1AR is certainly responsible for a large degree of the improvement seen in HF, such as LVEF improvement and survival benefits, but it is not the sole mechanism. Previous studies have suggested that the release of norepinephrine is partly regulated by prejunctional β2-adrenergic receptors [49], and that α1-ARs can also increase contractility equal to β -ARs in failing hearts [50]. As the importance of β2 and α1 AR in failing hearts, the role of β1 AR in patients who were treated with non-selective beta-blockers was weakened. Thus the association between the improvement of LVEF and Arg389Gly polymorphism was not significant among patients treated with non-selective β-blockers.As the progression of heart failure is associated with LVEF, it is expected the Arg389 homozygotes would get a better efficacy by selective β1-blockers therapy and Gly389 carriers might benefit more from non-selective β-blockers, which needs further investigation.In a study of 54 patients with HF, individuals with the Gly49 variant had greater improvement in LVEDd [29]. However, no association between Ser49Gly polymorphism and the change of LVEF was found [27], [31]. The being few studies, these findings need to be further confirmed.Although the therapeutic response to β-blockers was influenced by the β1 AR polymorphisms, no differences were found in the prognosis of heart failure. In theory, a better beta-blocker response might lead to potential adverse outcomes, such as HF deterioration, hypotension and bradycardia. But by now, there has been no data supporting the association between the β1 genetic polymorphisms and the adverse outcomes in prognosis. It is also believed that in the failing heart the density of β AR, especially the β1 AR, kept decreasing [51]. In our meta-analysis, the follow-up time of studies on prognosis of HF was relatively longer than that of studies on β-blocker responses. Thus the density of β1-AR in studies on prognosis of HF was more decreased than that in studies on beta-blocker responses. Therefore, the β1 AR played a more important role in response to β-blockers than that in prognosis of HF. Recently, a meta-analysis [52] has shown that the patients enrolled in the United States were associated with a lower magnitude of survival benefit to β-blockade than the ones from the rest of the world. The result demonstrated that the determining prognosis in HF is complex. Besides genetic factors, the cultural or social differences in disease management may also cover the impact of β1-AR polymorphisms. In addition, the sample size would have been too small to detect the differences.In the future, large sample clinical trials which investigate both the response to beta-blockers and prognosis in the same group of patients may make more sense for this problem.LimitationFirst of all, we evaluated the relationships between heart failure and the two functional β1 AR polymorphisms, Ser49Gly and Arg389Gly respectively. Since the two polymorphisms are in strong linkage disequilibrium (LD) [53], the combined effects in haplotypes may be more decisive in susceptibility to HF, response to β-blocker therapy, and prognosis.Secondly, in the 10 studies for prognosis of HF, the percentage of patients treated with beta-blockers ranged from 70% to 100%. The non-treated cases could not be excluded so that our results would inevitably be compromised. It’s a limitation of our meta-analysis. But in reality, some patients with heart failure due to the presence of contraindications cannot use β-blockers. Therefore, we believe that the current results were closer to clinical practice.At last, the sample size for each study was relatively small, even though all the studies in which the data could be achieved were collected for analysis, yet prospective studies with large sample size are warranted.ConclusionBased on the present meta-analysis, we found that the Gly389 allele and Gly389 homozygote were associated with the increasing risk of HF in East Asians; but in whites, Gly389 allele and Gly389 homozygote trended to decrease the risk of HF. The Ser49Gly polymorphism of β1 receptor was not associated with risk of HF. With the similar reduction of heart rate, overall, the Arg389 homozygotes performed a better response to β-blocker therapy. Furthermore, the Arg389 homozygotes were significantly associated with better LVEF improvement in East Asians and mixed population. And in white people, the Arg389 homozygotes made a greater LVESd\/v improvement and trended to be associated with better LVEDd\/v improvement. However, neither of the two β1 AR polymorphisms impacted the prognosis of HF based on our data. The results of our meta-analysis would provide a reference for individualized treatment of HF, and are also helpful in future prospective clinical trials.","Supporting InformationChecklist S1(DOC)Click here for additional data file."],"title":"Role of beta adrenergic receptor polymorphisms in heart failure: systematic review and meta-analysis."},{"documentAbstract":"Hypothyroidism is the most common hormonal disease in adults, which is frequently accompanied by learning and memory impairments and emotional disorders. However, the deleterious effects of thyroid hormones deficiency on emotional memory are poorly understood and often underestimated. To evaluate the consequences of hypothyroidism on emotional learning and memory, we have performed a classical Pavlovian fear conditioning paradigm in euthyroid and adult-thyroidectomized Wistar rats. In this experimental model, learning acquisition was not impaired, fear memory was enhanced, memory extinction was delayed and spontaneous recovery of fear memory was exacerbated in hypothyroid rats. The potentiation of emotional memory under hypothyroidism was associated with an increase of corticosterone release after fear conditioning and with higher expression of glucocorticoid and mineralocorticoid receptors in the lateral and basolateral nuclei of the amygdala, nuclei that are critically involved in the circuitry of fear memory. Our results demonstrate for the first time that adult-onset hypothyroidism potentiates fear memory and also increases vulnerability to develop emotional memories. Furthermore, our findings suggest that enhanced corticosterone signaling in the amygdala is involved in the pathophysiological mechanisms of fear memory potentiation.

and functional brain adaptability is the basis for learning and memory. The integration of both external and internal signals as hormones modulates this plasticity. Thus, it has long been demonstrated that hormonal imbalances induce alterations in cognition, memory, and mood state [1]. A large number of epidemiological and experimental studies have shown that deficiencies in thyroid hormones (TH, triiodothyronine or T3 and thyroxine or T4) during critical periods of development induce irreversible brain damage affecting learning and memory capacities [2], [3]. Over the last few decades, a great effort has been made to implement programs for the prevention of neonatal hypothyroidism [4]. However, less attention has been paid to adult-onset hypothyroidism and its consequences, as it is a frequent condition in humans with the prevalence increasing with age [5], [6].The main mechanism of TH action is modulation of gene expression in target cells through the binding of T3 to specific nuclear thyroid hormone receptors (TRs), mainly TRα1 and TRβ1, which act as aporeceptors and ligand modulated transcription factors [7]. Recent studies from various laboratories, including our own, using experimental animals demonstrate that adult-onset hypothyroidism impairs brain plasticity from molecular to macro-structural events with functional consequences. Adult hypothyroid rats show alterations in the expression of striatal synaptic plasticity proteins [8], reduced number of dendritic spines of cortical pyramidal neurons [9] and decreased adult hippocampal neurogenesis [10], [11], [12]. In addition, long-term potentiation (LTP) induction in hippocampal synaptic pathways [13], [14], [15] and some, but not all, hippocampal-dependent learning and memory processes are impaired in adult hypothyroid animals [12], [13], [14]. Interestingly, patients with hypothyroidism suffer not only from memory deficits [16], [17], [18], but also from emotional disturbances [5], [19]. Due to the common association between abnormal TH levels and psychiatric disturbances, it has been strongly recommended to evaluate thyroid function in patients with affective disorders [20].Limbic regions involved in cognitive processes and emotional responses are sensitive to hormonal alterations. The amygdala (key to fear conditioning) shows high levels of TRs [21], [22] and of type 2 deiodinase, the enzyme responsible for the local conversion of T4 to nuclear active T3 [23], hence, the amygdala is likely to be an important target region for TH action. In spite of this, to our knowledge, no studies have analyzed the contribution of TH to Pavlovian fear conditioning, the most studied form of amygdala-related emotional memory [24], [25]. In this paradigm, an initially neutral conditional stimulus (CS, a tone or a context) is paired with an aversive unconditional stimulus (US, an electric foot shock). After single or repeated CS-US pairings, the CS alone elicits conditioned responses such as freezing, in that all movements cease, except those required to breathe [26]. The aversive stimulus induces the release of stress hormones, glucocorticoids (corticosterone in rats and cortisol in humans) that play an important modulatory influence on fear memory consolidation acting through glucocorticoid receptors at the lateral\/basolateral (LA\/BLA) nuclei of the amygdala (for review see [27]). In addition, the conditioned response can be reduced or extinguished by the repeated presentation of the CS in the absence of the US. Therefore, animal studies using Pavlovian fear conditioning and extinction can help to investigate the pathogenesis of human anxiety disorders [28], such as post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) [28], [29], [30], given that this disorder involves learned fear [31].In the present study we have used the Pavlovian fear conditioning paradigm in order to explore the effect of adult-onset hypothyroidism on emotionally driven learning and memory. Our results show that euthyroidism is necessary for proper processing of emotional memories, as hypothyroidism enhances fear memory, delays extinction and exacerbates spontaneous recovery of fear memory. Our studies also suggest an abnormal glucocorticoid signaling in the amygdala as an important pathophysiological mechanism in hypothyroidism. The relevance of our findings is underlined by the clinical significance of TH in affective disorders and their potential role in PTSD and their treatment.","ResultsAdult-Onset Hypothyroidism Potentiates Contextual and Auditory Fear MemoryTo evaluate the effects of adult-onset hypothyroidism on functional alterations on fear memory, we used Pavlovian contextual and auditory delay fear conditioning tests following the experimental design explained in Methods (Experiment 1) and Figure 1A. Auditory delay fear conditioning depends on the integrity of the amygdala, whilst contextual fear conditioning is sensitive to both amygdala and hippocampal lesions [32]. In the conditioning session euthyroid (E) and hypothyroid (H) rats showed similar freezing levels during pre and post-shock intervals (t14 = 0.178, p = 0.862 and t14 = 1.576, p = 0.137, respectively; Figure 1B). These results indicate that hypothyroidism does not interfere with conditioning acquisition.10.1371\/journal.pone.0026582.g001Figure 1Contextual and auditory cued fear conditioning tests in euthyroid and adult-onset hypothyroid rats.(A) Schematic representation of the experimental design. Shadowed areas indicate periods of animal manipulations. (B) Conditioning session for auditory and contextual cues. No differences were found in neither pre-shock nor post-shock periods.

(D) Auditory cued fear testing 2 days, 1 week and 3 weeks after the conditioning session. H rats showed higher freezing levels during the tone period than their E counterparts at every test session after conditioning. Plot bars show means ± SEM. *, p<0.05; **, p<0.01; NS, no significant. n = 8 per group.For contextual fear conditioning testing, the rats were placed inside the original conditioning chamber, but no foot shock was delivered. Rats' behavior was registered 1 day, 1 week and 3 weeks after conditioning. Repeated-measures analysis showed a significant effect for session and group (p<0.001 in both cases). H animals displayed higher freezing levels in contextual fear memory as compared to E rats (a 64% increase 1 day, a 53% increase 1 week and a 95% increase 3 weeks after conditioning). Statistically significant differences between groups were found in sessions performed 1 day and 3 weeks after conditioning (t14 = 2.544, p = 0.023 at 1 day; t14 = 1.576, p = 0.137 at 1 week and t14 = 2.260, p = 0.040 at 3 weeks sessions; Figure 1C).To test the auditory cued fear memory the rats were located in a new context changing the environment where conditioning and contextual test sessions were performed. Rat's behavior was registered for pre-tone and tone periods 1 day after each contextual fear conditioning test. Freezing levels in the auditory testing boxes before tone reappearance remained low in both groups, indicating that the new context differs significantly to the original context and was not recognized by the animals. There were no differences between groups during pre-tone period in any case (p>0.15, not shown). During tone period, repeated-measures analysis showed a significant effect for session and group (p<0.001 in both cases). Repeated-measures analysis showed a significant effect for session and group (p<0.001 in both cases). H animals showed a statistically significant increase in freezing levels at every test session as compared to their E counterparts (24% increase, t14 = 2.421, p = 0.030 at 2 days; 35% increase, t14 = 3.064, p = 0.013 at 1 week and 61% increase, t14 = 2.602, p = 0.020 at 3 weeks sessions; Figure 1D). These results indicate that adult-onset hypothyroidism leads to long lasting robust fear memory.Adult-Onset Hypothyroidism Delays Extinction and Exacerbates Spontaneous Recovery of Auditory Cued Fear MemoryIn Experiment 1 we observed that hypothyroid rats displayed increased auditory fear memories even 3 weeks after conditioning, at a time when controls show a clear decrease in freezing levels that may be due to forgetting or extinction processes, or both. Since procedures in experiment 1 were not designed to evaluate extinction, we decided to explore whether the long lasting effects of hypothyroidism on auditory cued fear memory were due to failure in extinction learning to the repeated presentation of the conditioning tone in the absence of shock (Experiment 2, Figure 2A).10.1371\/journal.pone.0026582.g002Figure 2Auditory cued fear conditioning training, memory, extinction and spontaneous recovery tests in euthyroid and adult-onset hypothyroid rats.(A) Scheme showing the experimental design for Experiment 2. Shadowed areas indicate periods of animal manipulations. (B) Conditioning session. No differences were found in neither pre-shock nor post-shock periods. (C) Auditory cued fear test session 2 days after conditioning. H animals showed a significant increase in conditioned behavior. (D) Extinction sessions for the auditory cue fear memory. The extinction of fear memory was delayed in H animals. (E) Re-exposition to the tone for the assessing of spontaneous recovery of fear memory. H rats showed a remarkable increase (four-fold) in fear response as compared to E rats. Bars show mean ± SEM. *, p<0.05; **, p<0.01; NS, no significant. n = 7 for E rats and n = 8 for H rats.First, the animals were again conditioned to the tone and tested 2 days after conditioning. The results further confirm that adult-onset hypothyroidism does not interfere with basal fear levels and conditioning acquisition (pre-shock: t13 = 0.198, p = 0.846; post-shock: t13 = 1.319, p = 0.210; Figure 2B), but induces a potentiation of auditory fear memory (43% increase, t13 = 2.343, p = 0.036; Figure 2C).We then analyzed the effects of hypothyroidism on fear extinction. Both groups of animals showed a decrease in freezing behavior across the 3 extinction sessions. However, memory extinction was more rapid in E animals that showed almost a complete extinction of fear (freezing level <20%) at session 2, while this occurred in H animals at session 3 (Figure 2D). Repeated-measures analysis showed significant effects for session (p<0.001) and group (p = 0.002). Differences between groups were restricted to the second extinction session (t13 = 3.287, p = 0.007). These results indicate a delay in fear extinction in H rats.Extinguished fear conditioned responses often reappear after a time without further extinction training through spontaneous recovery. One week after the last extinction session, the animals were re-exposed to the auditory cue for measurement of the spontaneous recovery of emotional memory. H animals exhibited a greater than four-fold increase in freezing behavior as compared to E rats (t13 = 3.332, p = 0.005).Adult-Onset Hypothyroidism Alters Basal and Fear Conditioned-Induced Plasma Corticosterone Levels without Affecting the Weight of Adrenal GlandsWe decided to analyze if fear memory potentiation in H rats could be related to alterations in post-conditioning hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis reactivity. First, basal plasma corticosterone levels were measured in naïve animals. H animals showed an increase in basal corticosterone levels as compared to euthyroid animals (E = 35.7±4.6 ng\/ml; H = 60.7±5.3 ng\/ml; t12 = 3.545, p<0.004). To analyze post-conditioning HPA axis reactivity, the corticosterone response curve was studied at different time points after foot shock delivery, which acts as a stressor (Figure 3B). Repeated-measures analysis revealed significant effects of sampling time (p<0.001) and group (p = 0.003). Area under the curve (AUC) analysis showed an increase in corticosterone response in H animals as compared to E rats (t12 = 2.268, p = 0.043; Figure 3C). This result shows that corticosterone stress response after fear conditioning is enhanced in adult-onset hypothyroidism. No significant changes in relative weight of adrenal glands were observed between both groups of animals (Experiment 3, t12 = 1.018, p = 0.349; Table 1).10.1371\/journal.pone.0026582.g003Figure 3Plasma corticosterone levels and sensitivity to foot shocks in euthyroid and hypothyroid rats.(A) Scheme showing the experimental design for Experiment 3.

Variations in amygdala volume have been associated with alterations in fear memory processing in experimental animals [33] and with several neurological and neurodegenerative disorders in humans [34]. However, in this particular instance, no differences were found in the mean volume of the LA\/BLA between E (mean ± SD = 1.89±0.22 mm3) and H (1.93±0.23 mm3) rats (t6 = 0.247; p = 0.813; Figure 4A).10.1371\/journal.pone.0026582.g004Figure 4Expression of glucocorticoid, mineralocorticoid and thyroid hormone receptors in the lateral and basolateral nuclei of the amygdala in euthyroid and hypothyroid rats.(A) Amygdala volume estimation in E and H rats.

The expression of MR and GR was analyzed in adult E and H naïve rats at 120 days of postnatal age (P120) using immunohistochemistry. The specificity of the antibodies used was shown previously by others [36], [37]. The overall aspect and distribution of GR-immunoreactive (-ir) and MR-ir cells fitted well with earlier descriptions [38]. Moderate signal was found in the LA\/BLA for both MR and GR and both markers showed a nuclear staining, with a wide range of signal intensity, from weak to very strong. The nuclear staining showed a speckled pattern with a clear nucleolus (Figure 4 B–C and E–F). The densitometric analysis of overall staining for expression of both MR and GR in LA\/BLA showed an increase in H animals as compared to E rats (t6 = 4.904, p = 0.003; Figure 4D and t6 = 2.880; p = 0.028; Figure 4G, respectively), suggesting that MR and GR mRNA expression are upregulated in adult-onset hypothyroidism.TRβ1 mRNA Expression, but no TRα1, is Decreased by Adult-Onset Hypothyroidism in the LA\/BLAWe also investigated the influence of hypothyroidism on the expression of TRβ1 and TRα1 (the most abundant TRs in the mature brain), as unliganded TRs repress the transcription of positively modulated T3 target genes. TRα1 and TRβ1 mRNA expression was analyzed by in situ hybridization in the forebrain of E and H rats. Our results showed differential expression patterns for each isoform (data not shown) as previously described [21], [22]. No differences were found in the general pattern of expression for neither TRα1 nor TRβ1 between E and H animals. TRα1 mRNA highest expression levels were found in the dentate gyrus of the hippocampal formation and layer II of pyriform cortex. Overall, TRβ1 mRNA showed lower levels of expression than TRα1 with highest expression levels in layers II, III and IV of the cingulate and insular cortex, perirhinal cortex, lateral septal nucleus and amygdala.In the amygdala, TRα1 mRNA showed a uniform distribution throughout the different nuclei (Figure 4 H–I). TRβ1 mRNA was expressed in all amygdaloid nuclei except in the central amygdaloid nucleus (Figure 4 K–L). In the LA\/BLA TRα1 expression showed no differences between groups (t4 = 1.955, p = 0.122; Figure 4J), while TRβ1 expression was significantly reduced in H animals as compared to E rats (t4 = 3.036, p = 0.032, Figure 4M).","DiscussionOur findings provide the first data on the influence of adult-onset hypothyroidism on emotional learning and memory. They show that hypothyroidism not only potentiates fear memory, but also delays extinction and facilitates the return of the extinguished behavior as observed in the spontaneous recovery test. Hypothyroidism also enhances the stress response to foot shock delivery, while in the LA\/BLA increases in MR and GR expression and decreases in TRβ1 expression levels are observed. These results suggest that TH play a key role in the mechanisms of fear memory processing.We evaluated acquisition of fear conditioning and fear memory by analyzing the response to different CS, context and tone, in the same animals (Experiment 1). Hypothyroidism does not affect the learning processes necessary for forming an aversive association between contextual or auditory information and the aversive stimulus. However, hypothyroidism potentiates the memory of this association over time, inducing a long-lasting fear memory. Given that after thyroidectomy a long period of time (at least 2 weeks) is required to reach hypothyroid TH concentrations in the brain [39], the experimental design to assess whether the absence of TH affects consolidation and\/or retrieval of fear memory is problematic. In any case, the fact that hypothyroidism potentiates fear memory points to alterations in amygdala functioning, although a hippocampus-dependent effect cannot be excluded. Hypothyroid rats showed low freezing levels in the context prior to tone testing, suggesting that the increased freezing observed during the tone tests was associatively mediated and not due to generalized fear. The possibility that the enhanced fear memory observed in H animals could be related to alterations in sensory abilities was discarded, as hypothyroidism did not modify the pain sensitivity to foot shock intensity. In addition, previous studies from our group using the same experimental model of adult-onset hypothyroidism did not show alterations in auditory system functionality evaluated with auditory brainstem response test [13]. Hence, we evaluated extinction and spontaneous recovery of auditory fear memory (Experiment 2). Although H rats were able to extinguish the aversive memory throughout the successive extinction trials, they showed a slower extinction curve. Importantly, the reemergence of conditioned responses after extinction training occurred at very low levels in E rats, while H rats showed a remarkable exacerbation of spontaneous recovery of the aversive memory. Interestingly, deficient extinction learning has also been found in patients with PTSD [40], [41], [42] and fear extinction is considered an important mechanism in PTSD exposure therapy in humans [31]. Given that extinction is considered a new learning in which the prefrontal cortex (PFC) inhibits the expression of the original fear memory [43], [44], it may be hypothesized that the delayed extinction observed in H rats is due to a deficit of inhibitory control of PFC on amygdala activation. Alternatively, the observed delay in fear extinction may be affected by the strength of prior auditory cued fear conditioning [45].The pathological mechanisms of hypothyroidism underlying potentiation of fear memory could be related to an enhancement of amygdala activity due to changes in gene expression. T3 modulates gene expression by the binding to specific TRs. In hypothyroidism, altered transcription of T3 target genes is mainly due to transcriptional repression by unliganded TRs [46]. Previous studies have demonstrated that hypothyroidism induces region-specific changes in TRs expression [47], [48]. However, to our knowledge, no studies have examined the effect of hypothyroidism on TRs expression in the amygdala, a brain region that shows prominent levels of TRs [22]. We analyzed the effects of hypothyroidism on the expression of TRα1 and TRβ1 in LA\/BLA nuclei, which are critically involved in fear memory [24], [25], [49]. The quantitative expression analyses showed a specific reduction of TRβ1 expression in LA\/BLA in H animals. As hypothyroidism would lead to an increase of unliganded TRβ1, it is tempting to speculate that a reduction in TRβ1 expression in H rats may decrease gene repression as an attempt to compensate T3 deficiency.The enhanced fear displayed by H rats could also be ascribed to a generalized action of TH deficiency in the brain. Nevertheless, this possibility is unlikely as different circuits are involved in different learning and memory tasks and adult-onset hypothyroidism does not interfere with all types of learning and memory processes, as indicated by our previous and other experimental and clinical studies [12], [13], [14], [17], [18]. Based on these and present results, it is tempting to speculate that under TH deficiency there is a hierarchy in preserving memory capacities related to survival, as fear memories, in order to avoid the situations that induced them, although this preservation leads to a potentiation of fear memory.Diverse evidence indicates that glucocorticoid modulation of memory consolidation, retrieval and extinction of emotionally arousing experiences involves a selective activation of corticosteroid receptors (GR and MR) in the LA\/BLA [25], [50]. Glucocorticoids are released after HPA axis activation in response to aversive stimuli [27]. Herein, H rats showed higher corticosterone levels after foot shock delivery that could account for their enhanced fear memory. Previous studies found that glucocorticoid release after fear conditioning training plays a key role in the consolidation of the aversive memory [51], [52]. In addition, subcutaneous injection of corticosterone or dexamethasone just after training increases the freezing response in auditory fear conditioning tests [53], [54]. In the present study, the levels of GR and MR were increased in the LA\/BLA of H animals. Hence, the novel finding of higher corticosterone plasma levels after fear conditioning together with an increased amygdalar GR levels in H rats may explain their altered emotional processing. Although we did not discriminate whether more cells express MR and GR or the expression levels per cell are increased, these emotional alterations are probably due to an increase in the number of liganded corticosteroids receptors.Effects of glucocorticoids on the hypothalamus-pituitary-thyroid (HPT) axis and of TH on the HPA axis are reciprocal and inversely related [55], [56]. However, mechanisms underlying these interactions are poorly understood and indirect, affecting hypothalamic and pituitary modulation as well as hormonal metabolism. In addition, compensating mechanisms may exist, however, reported results have been conflicting. In hypothyroid experimental animals, no changes or decreased basal plasma corticosterone levels have been reported. This variability is possibly due to the differences in the experimental methods used as the techniques to induce hypothyroidism (i.e. propylthiouracil may alter adrenal steroidogenesis and attenuate ACTH-induced corticosterone response) or to the use of anaesthesia [57], [58], [59], [60]. It is important to indicate that the selective surgical thyroidectomy used here resulted in no significant changes in the relative weight of adrenal glands and in a mild increase of basal corticosterone levels, far from stress-induced levels. In humans, basal serum cortisol levels are mostly in normal ranges in primary and secondary hypothyroidism, as well as in hyperthyroidism, due to compensated cortisol secretion and metabolism owing to the intact HPA feedback relationship [55], [56]. However, interestingly, increased basal cortisol levels have been found in patients with primary hypothyroidism [61] and in thyroidectomyzed patients with differentiated thyroid cancer during acute hypothyroidism induced by T4 withdrawal [62], as occurs in the thyroidectomized rats from this study. The experimental model used in this study could be considered as a model to analyze the consequences of the clinical protocols that include hypothyroidism for several weeks in the treatment and follow-up of differentiated thyroid cancer as patient preparation for 131I-scanning after thyroidectomy.The effects of TH deficiency on stress-induced glucocorticoids release are poorly understood. In our study, stress-induced release of corticosterone is clearly upregulated in H animals. Several points in the corticosterone production and metabolism could be altered involving acute stress responses. Interestingly, physical stress (foot shock) causes a decrease in TH in adult rats [63].Basal cortisol levels in hypo- and hyperthyroid patients are not considered clinically relevant, due to the minor changes observed. Our present results suggest that under stressful situations the hypothyroidism-induced dysregulation of the HPA axis is greatly intensified and should be taken into account. Further studies should be performed to better understand the mechanisms underlying the interaction between the HPA-HPT axes under fear conditioning learning in normal and pathological situations.Our results suggest an increased susceptibility to traumatic and emotional memories induced by adult-onset hypothyroidism. Fear memory potentiation in H rats would involve maladaptation, as emotional information of moderate intensity would trigger an exaggerated behavioral response. Inappropriate regulation of fear can lead to negative physical and psychological outcomes such as phobia, panic disorder or PTSD. Many treatments for these disorders are based on progressive extinction of fear memories through repeated exposure to the conditioned stimulus [31]. Thus, hypothyroidism-induced inability to properly extinguish fear memories and the strong recall of these memories could increase the risk for traumatic illnesses and resistance to extinction treatments. Interestingly, in PTSD patients, both increased and decreased TH levels have been found [64], [65], [66], [67]. Moreover, it has been suggested that the type of traumatic experience may influence the response of the thyroid system [67]. To our knowledge, only one study in the literature investigated the effects of hypothyroidism on PTSD in humans [66]. In this study, Kamoi et al. observed that a number of symptoms related to PTSD two months after an earthquake were higher in patients with Hashimoto's disease (a common cause of primary hypothyroidism). In relation to this, it will be very interesting to determine in future studies if the alterations characterized in this study in H rats could lead to permanent or transient damage, as we have observed in previous studies [12], [13].Investigating factors, like hypothyroidism, that influence the acquisition and maintenance of Pavlovian fear conditioning in experimental animals will help to elucidate the psychobiological mechanisms that modulate the development and severity of some PTSD symptoms and their treatment.","Materials and MethodsEthics StatementAll experimental procedures were performed following the European Union Council guidelines (86\/609\/EEC and 2003\/65\/EC) and Spanish regulations (BOE 252\/2005, 34367-91) for the use of laboratory animals in chronic experiments, and were approved by the ethics committee of our institution (CSIC; approval numbers PN2007-116 and PN2010-55). All surgery was performed under anesthesia (intraperitoneal injection of a mixture of ketamine 100 mg\/kg and medetomidine 0.1 mg\/kg), and all efforts were made to minimize suffering.Experimental AnimalsAdult male Wistar rats were housed in temperature controlled animal quarters with automatic light\/dark cycles of 12\/12 h. Thyroidectomized hypothyroid (H) rats and sham-operated euthyroid (E) rats were analyzed. Thyroidectomy was performed at P75 following a well established protocol in our laboratory, which leaves the parathyroids intact and where H rats are fed a low iodine diet starting the day of surgery [12], [13], [68]. To confirm thyroidal status, all rats were weighed twice a week and plasma T3 and T4 levels were measured from every animal after sacrifice (P150, except animals for histological studies that were sacrificed at P125) as previously described [69]. No differences were found in T3 or T4 levels between both ages (n = 30 for E rats and n = 31 for H rats). Thyroidectomized rats had significantly lower circulating T3 and T4 levels and a significantly reduced body weight (BW) gain since thyroidectomy than that of E animals (Table 1). This indicates that our experimental animals are adequate to study the effects of adult-onset hypothyroidism on emotional memory. Adrenal glands were excised and weighted (Table 1; n = 7 per group). The relative adrenal glands weight refers to absolute adrenal glands weight\/100 g BW.Delay Fear ConditioningThe animals were housed in groups of 2–3 animals\/cage. They were handled for 2 min daily for 3 days before each experiment for habituation to experimental manipulations. Tests were always conducted between 08.00 and 13.30 h to avoid the influence of circadian hormonal fluctuations. All tests began at P125, 50 days after surgery. Conditioning and testing took place in a rodent observation cage using a shock generator (model LI100–26 Shocker, LETICA I.C., Madrid, Spain) as previously described [70], [71]. The observation cage (30×37×25 cm) was placed in a sound-attenuating chamber. The side walls of the observation cage were constructed of stainless steel and the back walls and doors were constructed of clear Plexiglass. The floor consisted of 20 steel rods through which a scrambled shock from could be delivered. The observation cage was cleaned with a 0.1% acetic acid solution before and after each session. Ventilation fans provided a background noise of 68 dB and a 20 W white light bulb illuminated the chamber.Firstly, we explored in Experiment 1 (Figure 1A) possible functional alterations in hippocampal and\/or amygdala-dependent fear memories in H animals on contextual and auditory delay fear conditioning using a foot shock as US (n = 8 for each E and H groups). On the conditioning day each rat was transported from the colony room to the laboratory (situated in adjacent rooms) and placed in the conditioning chamber. After 3 min, three tone-shock pairings were delivered with an inter-shock interval of 60 s. The tone (85 dB sound at 1000 Hz) was presented for 20 s and at the end of each tone an electric foot shock was delivered (1 s, 0.4 mA, constant current). The rats were removed from the conditioning chambers 30 s after the final shock presentation, and returned to their home cages. Thus, a conditioning session lasted ∼5.5 min. Testing for contextual fear conditioning was performed 1 day, 7 days (1 week) and 21 days (3 weeks) after conditioning. At testing, rats were placed back in the same chamber as used for conditioning but in the absence of shock or tone, for an 8 min context test. Testing for auditory fear conditioning was performed 2 days, 8 days (1 week) and 22 days (3 weeks) after conditioning. Rats were placed in the absence of shock in a novel context (same cages but with different walls, floor and background odor) in the absence of the conditioning tone (3 min; pre-tone period) and then re-exposed to the tone (5 min; tone period). Using a time-sampling procedure the behavior was evaluated in each experimental session and each rat was scored blindly as either freezing or active every 2 s. Freezing was defined as behavioral immobility except for movement required for breathing. This freezing response is considered as a fear index. At conditioning, behavioral scores were noted for the 3 min period prior to shock (pre-shock period) and for the 2.5 min period starting immediately after presentation of the first shock (post-shock period). Scores for each of these periods were analyzed separately. At testing for auditory fear conditioning the scores for the pre-tone and tone periods were also considered separately. At testing for contextual fear conditioning the scores for the total 8 min context test were analyzed. To perform the statistical analysis the data were transformed to a percent of total time.Secondly, we evaluated in Experiment 2 (Figure 2A) the effects of adult-onset hypothyroidism on the extinction and spontaneous recovery of auditory delay fear memory in an independent group of rats (n = 7 and n = 8 for E and H groups, respectively). The conditioning and auditory test session (2 days test session) were conducted and analyzed as explained in Experiment 1. Three extinction sessions were performed on consecutive days starting 2 days after the test session. In the extinction sessions, rats were placed in the absence of shock in a novel context during 10 min. Each minute consisted in 40 s in the absence of the conditioning tone and 20 s of the re-exposure to the tone (same tone as in training). During extinction no shock was delivered. One week after the last extinction session, an auditory test session was performed to evaluate spontaneous recovery of the fear memory.Plasma Corticosterone MeasurementsPlasma corticosterone levels were measured in E and H animals (Experiment 3, Figure 3A; n = 7 per group). Blood samples (∼300 µl) were obtained by tail-nick procedure whilst the animal was smoothly wrapped with a cloth and the blood introduced into ice-cold EDTA capillary-system tubes (Sarstedt, Germany). To obtain basal levels, a sample was taken between 09.00h and 09.30h, two weeks before training the animals in the fear conditioning. To quantify corticosterone levels induced by fear conditioning procedure blood samples were taken at different time-points after auditory fear conditioning training (15, 45 and 90 min). Subsequently, blood samples were centrifuged (3000 rpm for 20 min, at 4°C) and plasma was stored at −70°C. Corticosterone was measured using a radioimmunoassay kit (Coat-A-Count, Diagnostics Products Corporation; CA, USA; sensibility 5.9 ng\/ml; intra-assay variability 3.2–4.5%).Foot Shock Sensitivity TestTo assess if hypothyroidism modified the sensitivity to foot shocks in our experimental conditions (Experiment 3, Figure 3A; n = 7 per group), each rat was placed individually in a conditioning chamber different to that used for conditioning. After 120 s each rat received an ascending series of 1 s foot shocks, separated by 20 s, in 0.05 mA increments from 0 mA until the animal showed the first signs of discomfort (moving backwards and flicking their hind legs, scored as flinch) and pain (defined as the animal's paws leaving from the grid floor, jumping and vocalization, scored as jump). The shock intensity that elicited each of the two reactions was assessed. A lower shock intensity inducing the response is interpreted as greater sensitivity to the foot shock.Histological AnalysesAmygdala Volumetric AnalysisThe anatomy of the amygdala was analyzed by Nissl staining in parallel series to that used for immunohistochemical analyses (see below) using the atlas of Paxinos and Watson [72]. The Cavalieri method on point counts was used for the stereological estimation of the LA\/BLA volume. An average of 180–240 points was counted per LA\/BLA in a total of eight sections per animal. The mean CEs were 2.4% for both groups.Immunohistochemistry of Corticosteroid ReceptorsThe influence of thyroidal status on nuclear receptors expression was analyzed in groups of P125 naïve rats (n = 4 for each H and E groups) in order to avoid the stress from behavioral studies. Immunohistochemistry was performed as previously described [36], [73]. Briefly, rats were sacrificed at P125 (50 days after surgery) and transcardially perfused with 4% paraformaldehyde in 0.1 M PB. The brains were serially sectioned on a vibratome at 50 µm in the coronal plane. GR and MR expression was analyzed in the LA\/BLA at −1.50 to −3.60 from Bregma on free-floating sections using specific antibodies (rabbit antibody anti-GR, 1∶300; sc-8992, Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc., Santa Cruz, CA, USA [37]; mouse anti-MR, 1∶300; rMR1-18 1D5, developed by Celso Gomez-Sanchez [36], obtained from the Development Studies Hybridoma Bank developed under the auspices of the NICHD and maintained by the University of Iowa, Deparment of Biolological Sciences, Iowa City, 1A 52242). Biotinylated secondary antibodies (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA, USA) were used at a 1∶200 dilution. The immune signal was developed using the Vectastain Elite ABC Kit and DAB Peroxidase Substrate kit (Vector Laboratories), with nickel intensification.Nuclear receptors relative expression was studied under brightfield illumination with an Olympus BX51 microscope using planapochromatic lenses. To estimate the relative GR-ir and MR-ir signal in both experimental conditions, optical densitometric analysis of an unbiased systematic uniform random sampling was used [74]. Briefly, 60–70 microphotographs were taken in the LA\/BLA from six sections of each animal with an upper guard distance of 7 µm using an Olympus DP70 digital camera with an Olympus UPlanSApo 100X oil-immersion lens (1.40 numerical aperture). Stereological measurements were carried out in this microscope with the help of an interactive computer system comprising a high-precision motorized microscope stage, a 0.5-µm resolution microcator (Heidenhain VZR401) and the CAST stereological software package (Visiopharm, Hørsholm, Denmark, and Olympus España). Images were collected in TIFF format and transformed to 8-bit gray and using the image analysis software ImageJ (Beta 4.0.2, Scion, Frederick, MD, USA). The median gray value of the pixels from the entire photograph was automatically assigned by ImageJ software. These data were corrected by the tissue background signal. The quantification was performed by an experimenter blind to the code.In Situ Hybridization of Thyroid Hormone ReceptorsFor in situ hybridization, a second group of naïve rats (n = 3 for each H and E groups) were sacrificed at P125 (50 days after surgery) and fixed by transcardial perfusion with 4% paraformaldehyde in 0.1 M PB. The brains were cryoprotected, frozen in dry ice, and serially sectioned on a cryostat at 25 µm in the coronal plane. The detection of TRβ1 and TRα1 mRNAs with 35S-labeled riboprobes at 1.6×107 cpm\/ml was performed in free-floating sections according to protocols previously described in detail [75]. Specific TRβ1 and TRα1 probes were designed based on the published rat cDNA sequences (accession no. J03819 and M18028, respectively). The following primers were used to amplify the TRβ1 specific sequence: forward 5′-CAGAAAAATGCCTTCCAGCCTG-3′ and reverse 5′-TCTCTTCGGTCTGGAAAGTCTG-3′. For TRα1 the primers were as follows: forward 5′-TCCACATGAAAGTCGAGTGCC-3′ and reverse 5′-CACACGGCCTTTCATAGCAAG-3′. The sections were mounted on coated slides, dehydrated, air dried, and exposed to Biomax MR film (Eastman Kodak, Rochester, NY, USA) for 17 days for TRβ1 and 11 days for TRα1 expression analysis. Autoradiographic films were scanned with a Coolscan II slide scanner (Nikon Corp., Tokyo, Japan) at a resolution of 1350 pixels\/inch. The histological sections were Nissl stained and low magnification microphotographs (2×) were carried out with an Eclipse E400 microscope and Dn100 digital camera (both, Nikon Corp., Tokyo, Japan). The LA\/BLA area identified in Nissl stained sections was drawn and superposed to the autoradiographic image. Densitometric quantification of mean grey values at the LA\/BLA was performed following procedures peviously described [74], [76], using ImageJ software on three sections from every animal in both experimental groups. Similar measurements were made in the white matter to correct the data for tissue background hybridization signal.Statistical AnalysisAll results were expressed as mean ± standard error of the mean (SEM) and significance of results was accepted at p≤0.05. The time each rat spent freezing was transformed to a percentage of freezing per minute. Statistical comparisons between groups were performed using Student's t-tests. To assess the statistical differences across sessions, repeated-measures generalized estimated equations were performed when appropriate (fixed effects: experimental group, session (repeated), group×session). The AUC of plasma corticosterone levels was calculated using the trapezoid rule. All analyses were performed using Statistics 18.0 system software (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA)."],"title":"Expression of type 2 iodothyronine deiodinase in hypothyroid rat brain indicates an important role of thyroid hormone in the development of specific primary sensory systems."},{"documentAbstract":"Pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) is a multi-factorial condition and the underlying pulmonary vascular disease is shaped by the combined action of genetic, epigenetic and immune-related factors. Whether and how gender, obesity and the metabolic syndrome modify PAH and associated right heart failure is under intense investigation. Estrogens may enhance the process of pulmonary angioproliferation, but may also protect the right ventricle under pressure. Obesity may affect the pulmonary circulation via interactions with inflammatory cells and mediators, or via alterations in endocrine signaling. Obesity is a major risk factor for pulmonary hypertension in patients with elevated pulmonary venous pressure and preserved LV ejection fraction. Given the overlap between PAH and autoimmune diseases, hypothyroidism in patients with PAH is commonly considered a consequence of an autoimmune thyroiditis. In the clinical setting of hyperthyroidism, severe pulmonary hypertension may develop due to a hyperdynamic circulation, but a more complex situation presents itself when hyperthyroidism is associated with PAH. We recently showed in a relevant animal model of severe PAH that thyroid hormone, via its endothelial cell-proliferative action, can be permissive and drive angioproliferation. Signaling via the integrin αvβ3 and FGF receptors may participate in the formation of the lung vascular lesions in this model of PAH. Whether thyroid hormones in euthyroid PAH patients play a pathobiologically important role is unknown- as we also do not know whether the commonly diagnosed hypothyroidism in patients with severe PAH is cardioprotective. This brief review highlights some recent insights into the role of metabolic and endocrine disorders in PAH.","pmid":"22837855","ranges":[{"attribute":"Title[0]","begin":48,"end":53},{"attribute":"Title[0]","begin":17,"end":25},{"attribute":"Abstract[0]","begin":895,"end":906},{"attribute":"Abstract[0]","begin":296,"end":303},{"attribute":"Abstract[0]","begin":290,"end":295},{"attribute":"Abstract[0]","begin":1458,"end":1467},{"attribute":"Abstract[0]","begin":805,"end":819},{"attribute":"Abstract[0]","begin":1587,"end":1601},{"attribute":"Abstract[0]","begin":1184,"end":1191},{"attribute":"Abstract[0]","begin":1438,"end":1445},{"attribute":"Abstract[0]","begin":1516,"end":1520},{"attribute":"Abstract[0]","begin":1710,"end":1714},{"attribute":"Abstract[0]","begin":935,"end":950},{"attribute":"Abstract[0]","begin":1079,"end":1094},{"attribute":"Abstract[0]","begin":1446,"end":1454},{"attribute":"Abstract[0]","begin":1192,"end":1199},{"attribute":"Sections[0]","begin":214,"end":221},{"attribute":"Sections[0]","begin":208,"end":213},{"attribute":"Sections[0]","begin":1885,"end":1899},{"attribute":"Sections[0]","begin":2317,"end":2324},{"attribute":"Sections[0]","begin":1584,"end":1591},{"attribute":"Sections[0]","begin":652,"end":656},{"attribute":"Sections[0]","begin":1312,"end":1316},{"attribute":"Sections[0]","begin":2309,"end":2313},{"attribute":"Sections[0]","begin":750,"end":762},{"attribute":"Sections[0]","begin":2093,"end":2105},{"attribute":"Sections[0]","begin":2325,"end":2333},{"attribute":"Sections[0]","begin":1009,"end":1019},{"attribute":"Sections[1]","begin":182,"end":193},{"attribute":"Sections[1]","begin":587,"end":594},{"attribute":"Sections[1]","begin":789,"end":796},{"attribute":"Sections[1]","begin":77,"end":88},{"attribute":"Sections[1]","begin":581,"end":586},{"attribute":"Sections[1]","begin":783,"end":788},{"attribute":"Sections[1]","begin":1709,"end":1713},{"attribute":"Sections[1]","begin":2238,"end":2242},{"attribute":"Sections[1]","begin":798,"end":806},{"attribute":"Sections[1]","begin":364,"end":371},{"attribute":"Sections[2]","begin":824,"end":843},{"attribute":"Sections[2]","begin":911,"end":930},{"attribute":"Sections[2]","begin":977,"end":988},{"attribute":"Sections[2]","begin":26,"end":41},{"attribute":"Sections[2]","begin":548,"end":552},{"attribute":"Sections[2]","begin":14,"end":25},{"attribute":"Sections[2]","begin":989,"end":996},{"attribute":"Sections[3]","begin":161,"end":166},{"attribute":"Sections[3]","begin":539,"end":546},{"attribute":"Sections[3]","begin":871,"end":878},{"attribute":"Sections[3]","begin":174,"end":182},{"attribute":"Sections[4]","begin":826,"end":837},{"attribute":"Sections[4]","begin":1143,"end":1154},{"attribute":"Sections[4]","begin":1229,"end":1234},{"attribute":"Sections[4]","begin":542,"end":551},{"attribute":"Sections[4]","begin":126,"end":140},{"attribute":"Sections[4]","begin":736,"end":750},{"attribute":"Sections[4]","begin":979,"end":986},{"attribute":"Sections[4]","begin":1056,"end":1063},{"attribute":"Sections[4]","begin":1363,"end":1370},{"attribute":"Sections[4]","begin":1440,"end":1447},{"attribute":"Sections[4]","begin":1597,"end":1604},{"attribute":"Sections[4]","begin":1160,"end":1167},{"attribute":"Sections[4]","begin":301,"end":313},{"attribute":"Sections[4]","begin":483,"end":495},{"attribute":"Sections[4]","begin":1820,"end":1836},{"attribute":"Sections[4]","begin":0,"end":7},{"attribute":"Sections[4]","begin":1168,"end":1176},{"attribute":"Sections[4]","begin":1371,"end":1379},{"attribute":"Sections[4]","begin":1448,"end":1456},{"attribute":"Sections[4]","begin":1605,"end":1613},{"attribute":"Sections[5]","begin":1802,"end":1809},{"attribute":"Sections[5]","begin":1796,"end":1801},{"attribute":"Sections[5]","begin":1839,"end":1848},{"attribute":"Sections[6]","begin":218,"end":234},{"attribute":"Sections[6]","begin":385,"end":401},{"attribute":"Sections[6]","begin":858,"end":874},{"attribute":"Sections[6]","begin":1229,"end":1245},{"attribute":"Sections[6]","begin":1713,"end":1729},{"attribute":"Sections[6]","begin":1905,"end":1921},{"attribute":"Sections[6]","begin":2064,"end":2080},{"attribute":"Sections[6]","begin":3100,"end":3116},{"attribute":"Sections[6]","begin":440,"end":445},{"attribute":"Sections[6]","begin":1415,"end":1424},{"attribute":"Sections[6]","begin":1536,"end":1545},{"attribute":"Sections[6]","begin":963,"end":972},{"attribute":"Sections[6]","begin":1163,"end":1172},{"attribute":"Sections[6]","begin":2796,"end":2805},{"attribute":"Sections[6]","begin":3054,"end":3063},{"attribute":"Sections[6]","begin":3423,"end":3432},{"attribute":"Sections[6]","begin":4,"end":8},{"attribute":"Sections[6]","begin":93,"end":100},{"attribute":"Sections[6]","begin":1976,"end":1983},{"attribute":"Sections[6]","begin":2579,"end":2586},{"attribute":"Sections[6]","begin":3188,"end":3195},{"attribute":"Sections[6]","begin":20,"end":27},{"attribute":"Sections[6]","begin":2603,"end":2607},{"attribute":"Sections[6]","begin":306,"end":319},{"attribute":"Sections[6]","begin":976,"end":989},{"attribute":"Sections[6]","begin":1177,"end"

heart failure) continue to be useful.[1] Although the clinical classification distinguishes between pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH; Group 1), pulmonary venous hypertension (Group 2), and pulmonary hypertension associated with thrombotic or embolic disease (Group 4), PAH (Group 1) combines at least three of the pathogenetically important mechanisms: vasoconstriction, hyperkinesis and vasoobliteration. Hyperkinesis plays an etiological role in PAH associated with congenital cardiac shunt abnormalities, porto-pulmonary hypertension, hyperthyroid disease-associated PAH and PAH associated with sickle cell anemia are all hyperkinetic, high cardiac output forms of severe PAH.[2–4] Clearly PAH, as classified, is a group of diseases with different long-term survival likely requiring different treatments.[5] Not only is PAH not a single disease, but it is also increasingly appreciated that disease-specific pathobiologically important mechanisms and neuroendocrine factors shape the disease and determine outcome in individual patients. For example, autoimmunity\/inflammation plays an important role in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus-associated pulmonary hypertension and in HIV\/AIDS-associated PAH.[67] Both genetic susceptibility factors and epigenetic influences need to be investigated for a more complete understanding of the pathobiology of PAH.[8] Thyroid disease and obesity are likely epigenetic disease modifiers, and if the REVEAL registrydata are representative; then pulmonary hypertension has now become overwhelmingly a disease of menopausal women.[8–11] A large number of publications have confirmed the initial report of an association of hypothyroidism and PAH and a recent review by Biondi et al established a strong link between Graves disease and multinodular goiter and PAH.[212–16] According to Biondi et al., more than 80% of patients with hyperthyroid diseases develop pulmonary hypertension. In this review, we wish to put PAH in a wider neuroendocrine disease context and summarize recent experiments which had been designed to investigate a functional role of thyroid hormones in the development of PAH.","ENDOCRINE MODIFIERS OF PULMONARY HYPERTENSIONThe association between PAH and hypothyroid disease hypothetically suggests that the patients had at some time experienced an autoimmune thyroiditis, and this association is cited as evidence of a participation of the immune system in the pathogenesis of PAH.[17] However, the broader context may be estrogen and other hormone-dependent mechanisms of disease development or disease modification (Fig. 1). In addition to endocrine factors which may modify the pathogenesis there are neuroendocrine factors which enter the stage as right heart failure develops; these are hyperaldosteronism and sympathetic overdrive.[19]Figure 1Overview of a general concept of the participation of the endocrine system in pulmonary hypertension and right heart failure. Hormones can be transported by carrier proteins to sites of paracrine signaling receptors or act as in an autocrine fashion. The “sick lung circulation” releases factors which act upon the myocardium [reprinted with permission].[18]Obesity, which is now understood as an inflammatory disease, may be a cotrigger of PAH or may worsen the inflammatory contribution of chronic pulmonary vascular diseases.[2021] Sweeney et al. in a survey of 88 patients with PAH found that 25% had a body mass index (BMI) of 30 kg\/ m2 or greater.[9] Epidemiological data suggest a significant association between increasing BMI and several cancers and Leung et al. pointed out that obesity was a risk factor for pulmonary hypertension in patients with elevated pulmonary venous pressure and preserved LV ejection fraction (Fig. 2).[2223] In addition to storing excess calories in the form of lipid, adipose tissue plays an active role in endocrine signaling. Adipocytes generate angiogenic leptin and adipokines and macrophages of the adipose tissue secrete IL-6. Circulating IL-6 levels are correlated with the BMI and adipose tissue is thought to account for 35% of circulating IL-6 in healthy people.[24] Interactions between IL-6 and estrogen may be important in cancer pathobiology. There is at present no information regarding dietary factors and their potential impact on the lung circulation. Based on strong literature data describing the angiogenic role of copper, a recent study explored copper deficiency and found that a Cu++-depleted diet prevented the development of angioobliterative PAH in the Sugen\/chronic hypoxia rat model.[25]Figure 2This diagram illustrates the connections between obesity, left ventricular dysfunction and pulmonary hypertension which can be pulmonary arterial or pulmonary venous hypertension.","VITAMIN D AND PARATHYROID HORMONEVitamins and vitamin deficiency states may also have to be included in the list of modifiers of pulmonary vascular diseases although potential connections between vitamin deficiencies and pulmonary hypertension remain unexamined. Vitamin D deficiency is a very frequent finding; in fact it has been reported that up to 90% of U.S. adults aged 50–70 are Vitamin D deficient.[26] Vitamin D is important as a controller of cell growth and regulator of immune functions.[27–29] Vitamin D may have an angioproliferative role in cancer mediated via HIF-1α.[30] Calcitriol (1,25[OH2] D3), the active form of Vitamin D, reduces the expression of VEGF and also endothelin.[30] Vitamin D deficiency was found in 49% of patients with the antiphospholipid syndrome and Ulrich et al. described secondary hyperparathyroidism in patients with pulmonary hypertension;[31] they suggest that the hyperparathyroidism is a consequence of vitamin D deficiency.[32] Parathyroid hormone (PTH) elevation may mobilize bone marrow-derived progenitor cells comparable to the effect of G-GSF.[33] PTH increases mesenchymal stem cell proliferation and stimulates VEGF expression in HUVEC.[3435]","ESTROGENIn recent years the “female pulmonary hypertension factor” has received recognition and investigators have begun to develop hypotheses which address the roles of sex hormones in the pathogenesis of pulmonary hypertension. PAH develops in young and in menopausal women; young women have high levels of circulating estrogen, while middle-aged women had a high cumulative exposure to estrogen and\/or to estrogen replacement therapy. Sweeney et al. surveyed female patients with PAH and reported that 80% of the women had prior use of hormone therapy whether estrogen is a risk factor for the development of PAH is not clear.[9] It is also not clear whether mechanistically an imbalance between pro-and-antiangiogenic estrogen metabolites is important, and whether estrogen receptors are involved remains unresolved.[18] However, any mechanistic model of sex steroid hormone impact on the lung circulation and lung vascular remodeling should consider an imbalance between androgens and estrogens. Sweeney et al. had collected serum samples from 70 patients with severe PAH and 18 normal control women and analyzed the samples for estrogen metabolites, using mass spectroscopy. This single time point analysis showed that patients of this PAH cohort had a relative 17-β-estradiol deficit when compared to age-matched control women.[36] To the degree that estrogen has cardioprotective effects this deficit may put women with PAH at a disadvantage.","THYROID DISEASEThe pulmonary hypertension group at the University of Colorado brought attention to an association of PAH with hypothyroidism.[12] Subsequently other investigators around the world have confirmed this association.[913–15] More recently an association between pulmonary hypertension and hyperthyroid conditions, in particular Graves disease and multinodular goiter, have been reported (Table 1).[37–42] In addition, there are several case reports of the development of hyperthyroid disease in patients with idiopathic PAH after treatment with prostacyclin. Remarkably there is no formulated hypothesis which provides a mechanistic explanation for these associations. Given the overlap between PAH and autoimmune diseases, hypothyroidism in patients with PAH is commonly considered a consequence of an autoimmune thyroiditis – as another manifestation of a still ill-defined underlying immune dysregulation. It is intriguing to speculate that in the lung and in the thyroid gland a common denominator is a disease of the microcirculation: the thyroid gland is hypervascularized in Graves disease but hypovascularized in Hashimoto thyroiditis.[43] Thyroid hormones can affect the cardiopulmonary system by increasing heart rate and blood flow through the lung. Pulmonary hypertension in Graves disease is in part due to a high cardiac output. Because thyroid hormones stimulate endothelial cell growth[44], we hypothesized that thyroid hormones can also contribute to the development of pulmonary hypertension by promoting angioproliferation. We therefore assessed the contribution of thyroid hormones to pulmonary vascular remodeling in the Sugen \/ chronic hypoxia rat model of severe PAH. The results of this study were published recently[45] and here we recapitulate the main findings of this study.Table 1Hyperthyroidism and pulmonary hypertension in clinical trials and case reports","THE SUGEN\/CHRONIC HYPOXIA MODEL OF PAHThis model is based on the combination of chronic VEGF receptor blockade and chronic hypoxia. The underlying concept is that two hits are required to generate severe angioobliterative PAH in the rat: Sugen 5416 (semaxinib) binds with high affinity to the intracellular tyrosine kinase part of VEGFR1 (flt1) and VEGFR2 (KDR) and thus inhibits the signal transduction of these two receptors while chronic hypoxia increases the resistance to blood flow via pulmonary vasoconstriction. Sugen 5416-induced VEGFR blockade causes loss of alveolar septal cells by inducing lung endothelial cell apoptosis.[4647] These emphysematic changes are accompanied by mild PAH.[46] Chronic hypoxia, in addition to causing an increase in pulmonary vascular shear stress, also activates inflammatory mechanisms and causes homing of precursor-or stem cells to the lung.[4849] We showed in our original description of this two-hit-model of PAH that the Sugen 5416-induced pulmonary endothelial cell apoptosis is necessary for the subsequent development of angioproliferation and Sakao et al. showed in a cell model of HUVEC subjected to high flow shear stress that Su5416 induced HUVEC apoptosis followed subsequently by lumen-filling proliferation of the HUVEC that had survived the initial apoptosis.[5051] It is probably of interest and worth mentioning that umbilical cord endothelial cells are fetal cells which contain also pluripotent precursor cells. The pulmonary arteriolar lesions in this model have been characterized to some extent and Abe et al. have reported that with passage of time these lesions resemble the plexiform lesions in the lungs from patients with severe PAH.[5253] The animals treated with Sugen 5416 and exposed to hypoxia for 4 weeks develop right heart failure and the PAH is refractory to treatment.[54–56]","THE ROLE OF THYROID HORMONE IN THE SUGEN\/HYPOXIA MODEL OF PAHTo address the question whether thyroid hormones contribute to the formation of the pulmonary angioobliteration we subjected in the first set of experiments thyroidectomized male rats to the standard Sugen\/chronic hypoxia protocol.[45] Subtotal thyroidectomy decreased plasma thyroxin (T4) to about 20% of the levels in non-thyroidectomized animals. The animals also had a lower heart rate and a lower cardiac output when compared to the Sugen\/chronic hypoxia animals – and importantly the mean pulmonary artery (mPAP) approached the mPAP observed in normal control rats not treated with Sugen or exposed to hypoxia (Fig. 3). Whereas approximately 40% of the precapillary arterioles were completely obliterated in the Sugen\/chronic hypoxia animals only 8% of these vessels were obliterated in the thyroidectomized Sugen\/chronic hypoxia animals (Fig. 4).[45]Figure 3The effect of propylthiouracil (PTU) treatment or thyroidectomy (THx) on the mean pulmonary arterial pressure (mPAP) of rats exposed to the Sugen 5416\/chronic hypoxia (SuHx) protocol. The mPAP was measured in anesthetized rats. Both PTU treatment and thyroidectomy reduced to the mPAP. One group of the thyroidectomized animals exposed to the SuHx protocol had thyroxin (T4) pellets implanted at the onset of the 4 weeks chronic hypoxia (SuHx-THx-T4). *P<0.05 different when compared with euthyroid controls. *P<0.05 different when compared with SuHx animals.Figure 4Lung tissue sections (HE staining) from an euthyroid normal control rat lung (A), higher magnification (B) a lung tissue section from a rat treated with Sugen 5416 and exposed to chronic hypoxia for 4 weeks (C, D) and a thyroidectomized rat exposed to Sugen 5416 and chronic hypoxia (E, F). In animals with a partial thyroidectomy no angioproliferative lesions were observed.We next implanted T4 pellets s.c. in thyroidectomized rats in order to prove that indeed it was lack of the thyroid hormone that had prevented the pulmonary vasoobliteration. The T4-reconstituted thyroidectomized rats were then subjected to the standard Sugen\/chronic hypoxia animal. These animals had slightly higher plasma levels of T4 then the normal control rats and when exposed to sugen and chronic hypoxia the degree of pulmonary hypertension was indistinguishable from that of nonthyroidectomized Sugen\/chronic hypoxia rats; however, the number of fully obliterated lung vessels was smaller than in the nonthyroidectomized Sugen\/hypoxia rats. Thus, in the aggregate the data support the conclusion that thyroid hormone plays a role in the development of angioproliferative PAH in this model. Next we used a different and pharmacological approach and inhibited T4 production in the rats with propylthiouracil (PTU). This treatment reduced plasma T4 hormone levels, and reduced the mPAP in Sugen\/chronic hypoxia animals and the number of fully obliterated pulmonary arterioles. There was a positive correlation between the RVSP and the number of obliterated vessels. Thus the PTU treatment data support the data obtained with thyroidectomized rats. Important control experiments were performed to find out whether thyroid hormone per se was sufficient to cause pulmonary angioproliferation: rats were injected with Su5416 (but not exposed to hypoxia) and T4 pellets were implanted s.c. and the animals were studied at four weeks after continuous T4 treatment.[45] Because the combination of Su5416+T4 did not cause angioproliferation, we conclude that T4 in the Sugen\/chronic hypoxia model is permissive and that Su5416-induced lung cell apoptosis by itself without accompanying hypoxia is not sufficient as a driver of exuberant T4-induced endothelial cell proliferation.","PUTATIVE MECHANISM OF THYROID HORMONE RELATED PULMONARY ANGIOOBLITERATION IN THE RAT MODEL OF PAHThyroid hormones activate membrane-and nuclear receptor pathways. Davis et al. described in elegant studies endothelial cell growth stimulated by T4 via the αvβ3 integrin and signaling via ERK1\/2 and STAT3.[4457–59] T4 can activate VEGF production as well as FGF-2 production. Because in the Sugen\/chronic hypoxia model two of three VEGF receptors are blocked, we wondered whether the T4-associated pulmonary angioproliferation could occur with the participation of the αvβ3\/FGF-2\/ERK1\/2 signaling. Indeed, using IHC we could show a strong expression of αvβ3, FGF-2, FGF-receptor and ERK1\/2 proteins in the vasoobliterative lesion cells – these signals were not expressed in the thyroidectomized Sugen\/chronic hypoxia rats.[45] These results provide the first hint that signaling via the integrin αvβ3 and FGF receptors may participate in the formation of the lung vascular lesions in this model of PAH. Experiments are underway to target these proteins using blocking antibodies.","CONCLUSIONSAs the WHO classification of PH illustrates, PAH is multifactorial and it is almost certain that in addition to the known genetic factors like BMPR2 mutations mediators of inflammation, immune system abnormalities and a host of epigenetic factors shape the pulmonary vascular disease in the individual patient.[1] Whether and how female factors, obesity and the metabolic syndrome modify PH is under intense investigation. Gender plays an important role in the pathobiology of heart diseases. The incidence of heart disease increases in women after menopause indicating that sex hormones play an important role in the development of heart disease.[60] This general statement likely applies to the right ventricle when under pressure in PAH.[19] Estrogen can be angioproliferative and protects cardiac myocytes against apoptosis.[60] As much as estrogen may enhance the process of pulmonary angioproliferation it may protect the myocardium of the right ventricle under pressure. To what extent thyroid hormones affect the pulmonary vascular\/right heart axis in PAH is understood only in part in the clinical setting of hyperthyroidism, with its dramatic manifestations of tachycardia and increased cardiac output. A more complex situation presents itself when hyperthyroidism is associated with PAH. We have illustrated in a relevant animal model of severe PAH that thyroid hormone, via its endothelial cell-proliferative action, can be permissive and drive angioproliferation.[45] Whether thyroid hormones in euthyroid PAH patients play a pathobiologically important role is unknown – as we also do not know whether the commonly diagnosed hypothyroidism in patients with severe PAH is cardioprotective."],"title":"Influence of sex hormones and phytoestrogens on heart disease in men and women"}],"keywords":"What is the role of thyroid hormones administration in the treatment of heart failure?","page":10,"size":10000,"timeMS":102973}}
